<h2 title="Preface" id="preface">PREFACE.</h2></div>

<p><em class="e000I2">The Banquistes</em> was the first title chosen for this book: it
has been altered for two reasons which appeared conclusive
after some consideration: the general public would have misunderstood
it, and it would certainly have wounded those
interested in it, who would have known what it meant.</p>

<p>But if we consult an etymological dictionary we shall find
that the word <em class="e0U003">SALTIMBANQUE</em>, which is more generally used
than <em class="e0U003">BANQUISTE</em>, is derived from a definite root: <em class="e0U003">SALTIMBANQUE</em>,
<em class="e000I2">s. m.</em>, from the Italian word <em class="e0U003">SALTIMBANCO</em>: who vaults on a
bench (Latin, <em class="e0U003">SALTARE IN BANCO</em>). In Italian we also find
the word <em class="e0U003">CANTIMBANCO</em>, a platform singer. I must add that
when, after tracing out the etymology of the words <em class="e0U003">SALTIMBANQUISTE</em>
and <em class="e000I2">banquiste</em>, we search for the origin of the word
<em class="e000I2">banker</em>, we shall find that the same radical, <em class="e0U003">BANCO</em>, is the root
<span class="xxpn" id="p-vi"></span>
of these three derivatives. In the old fairs two personages
were allowed to erect a small platform, a “banc”—the money-changer
and the acrobat. Perhaps the “banc” already served
as a spring-board, giving both the <em class="e0U003">BANKER</em> and the <em class="e0U003">BANQUISTE</em>
a greater impetus in their leap; perhaps we must even look
back to the same date to find the exact origin of the now
common expression “<em class="e0U003">LEVER LE PIED</em>” (to abscond).</p>

<p>However this may be, after the perusal of this book, it will
be readily understood that the contemporary acrobat, established,
enriched, emerging into the middle classes, indignantly
rejects a slang term which apparently assigns to him the same
origin as that of our modern financiers. This intolerance is
certainly not the only surprise reserved for the reader of these
pages. We claim to lead him to the threshold of an unknown
world.</p>

<p>Before commencing this work, which has absorbed us
during at least three years, I made a thorough investigation
of the bibliographic and monographic information now existing
upon the <em class="e000I2">banquiste</em> question, and I came to the conclusion
that no French or foreign author worth attention or quotation
had yet interested himself in this original people. M.
Houcke, the manager of the Hippodrome, had kindly placed
at our disposal a series of lithographs published in Germany.
But the text and the correctness of the work were so defective,
that the drawings were of no use to us. It was the
same with the <em class="e000I2">Saltimbanques</em>, which M. Escudier published at
the close of the Empire through Michel Lévy. The sole
merit of M. Escudier’s work lies in his discovery of an unknown
subject. He made the mistake of writing without
information, picturesqueness, or philosophy, in the light,
<span class="xxpn" id="p-vii"></span>
insufferably trifling tone, which is common to most of the
publications of that epoch.</p>

<p>Since then, a conscientious writer, M. Dalsème, who is
attached to the acrobats, has published a more interesting
account of them entitled <em class="e000I2">Le Cirque à Pied et à Cheval</em>.
The kindliness with which M. Dalsème alludes in his book
to the quotations which he has made from my publications
induces me to notice his work in return. And truly,
however unequal and incomplete his book may be, it is still
the most interesting work that has yet been seen upon a new
subject.</p>

<p>This judgment places M. Edmund de Goncourt’s novel, the
<em class="e000I2">Frères Zemganno</em>, far above this level, and beyond any invidious
comparison. Although exact observation is the
discipline of the novelist, M. de Goncourt has declared that
in this instance his chief object was to write a symbolical
book. His information was necessarily superficial. Such as
it was, I do not think that any one has now more reason than
ourselves for admiring the superior art and truth with which
M. de Goncourt has spoken of the circus, has formulated its
philosophy, depicted its passions, and divined those things
that were concealed from him. And I trust that the author
of the <em class="e000I2">Frères Zemganno</em> will be one of the first to enjoy the
novelty of this work.</p>

<p>The perusal of the so-called naturalistic novels has gradually
accustomed the public to a fairly strong dose of realism in
books. A number of young men have written in imitation of
the great masters, stories which, commonplace in themselves,
are yet worth reading for their conscientious observation of
the “surroundings.” A thousand inquiries upon contemporary
life have been cleverly made, and readers have examined
these social records with much curiosity.</p>

<p>It appeared to me that the best part of these novels, the
portions most appreciated by the readers, were the facts of
actual experience. I therefore asked myself if the time had
not come to present to the public these facts free from all
romantic fiction, in a form in which the author only intervenes
in order to arrange the incidents and to point out the philosophy
to be derived from them.</p>

<p>The success of this book will prove whether the attempt is
premature, or whether there will be any reason for a sequel.</p>

<p>This publication is really the monograph of an unknown
people, related by the pen and pencil. Its laws, its customs,
its traditions, its secrets, its hopes, have been seized,
defined in spite of reticence, evasions, wavering, and contradictory
witnesses. It describes the organization of the
<em class="e000I2">banquiste</em> people, the foundation of its agencies, newspapers,
and syndicates, it follows the mountebank from his birth in the
wandering caravan to his apotheosis in the friezes of the
circus. And at the same time it penetrates into the stables to
explain the secrets of the trainer, the tamer, and the ring-master;
into the booths to ask the clown for the story of his
adventures—and by what chance, having become a gentleman
himself, he one day met in the land of whims a gentleman
who had become a clown!</p>

<p>I cannot close this preface without addressing the warmest
thanks to all those who have aided us in bringing this work
to a successful issue—to our willing correspondents from
America, England, Germany, and Russia. But whilst thus
paying our debts, we must express our special gratitude to
<span class="xxpn" id="p-ix"></span>
the learned director of the photographic department of the
Salpêtrière, M. Albert Londe; to M. Guy de la Brettonière,
the well-known <em class="e000I2">circomane</em>; to amateurs like MM. de Saint-Senoch,
Bucquet, and Mathieu. The photographs which these
gentlemen kindly took for us enabled the draughtsman to
represent the acrobats in <em class="e0U003">THOSE INTERMEDIATE POSES WHICH
THE EYE NEVER SEIZES</em>, and which hitherto the most rapid
instantaneous photographs have failed in reproducing. A
few figures will prove better than any words the extreme
rarity of these plates.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1888, M. Houcke having given us
an appointment at the Hippodrome, made the clown, Auguste,
and an artist of the fixed bar, vault in our presence. The
members of the Société d’Excursions Française de Photographie,
headed by its president, were nearly all assembled. Fifty
cameras were arranged like a battery: each amateur had
brought twelve glasses. After they had been examined, M.
Albert Londe sent us ten proofs, which alone out of six
hundred had been deemed worthy of being printed, and after
a final examination only seven plates were preserved by the
painter. They inspired the series of somersaults which are
found in the chapter on <em class="e0U003">GYMNASTS</em>.</p>

<span class="smaller">ORGANIZATION.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">Parisians live in scandalous ignorance of the beings
who surround them and of the world in which they
move. Although fond of curious entertainments, they have
never made any serious inquiries about the origin, the private
life, or the terms of enlistment of the skilful artists whom
they applaud in the circus, the theatre-concert, or the playhouse.
I have often heard persons who considered themselves
well informed, and who spoke with much reserve and many
hints of deeper knowledge, assert that secret manufactures
of monstrosities exist in the world, training schools for acrobats,
registry offices for mountebanks; and that by diligent
search, with a little discreet assistance from the police, one
might discover branches of these picturesque establishments
in the thieves’ quarters of old Paris.
<span class="xxpn" id="p002">[p002]</span></p>

<p>This story is enough to frighten children, but it must be
allowed to pass away with the dust of other fabrications
destroyed by time, whilst you may rely upon the accuracy
of the information contained in this book; its sole ambition
is to enlighten you on this mysterious subject by telling you
the truth about it.</p>

<p>The collection of all these facts has been a work of time.
The mountebank is too jealous of his freedom to talk openly
to every one that approaches him. The same patience which
travellers use in their relations with savages must be employed
before one can hope for any intimacy with this
people, who are still as much scattered, as varied, as strangely
mixed, as vagabond, as their ancestors, the gipsies, who, guitar
on back, hoop in hand, their black hair encircled with a
copper diadem, traversed the Middle Ages, protected from
the hatred of the lower classes and the cruelty of the great
by the talisman of superstitious terror.</p>

<p>This tribe, recruited from every nation and every type,
is called, in its particular <em class="e000I2">argot</em>, the
<em class="e000I2">banque</em>;<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
there is the
<em class="e000I2">grande banque</em> and the <em class="e000I2">petite banque</em>: its members are called
<em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>.</p>

<p>Qualities transmitted through many generations, natural
selection always tending in the same direction—of strength
and dexterity—have, in course of time, endowed this
<span class="xxpn" id="p003">[p003]</span> international
people with special characteristics. With regard to
the superior instincts, they possess a taste for adventure,
wonderful facility in acquiring languages, in assimilating
every variety of civilization, and a strange amalgamation
of qualities, which would seem incompatible with each other—Italian
pliancy, Anglo-Saxon coolness, German tenacity.
I do not quote the influence of French characteristics in the
fabrication of these free citizens of the world: the soil of
France is so dear to her children that, even if they tempt
the glory and perils of an acrobat’s life, they rarely leave
their native land. According to statistics, Frenchmen form
a proportion of but five per cent, in the tribe of <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>
who travel round the world. But these mountebanks are
not so numerous as one might imagine; in all there are only
a few thousands. But earth contains no guests more free
than these men, whom the poet Theodore de Banville greets
as the “brothers of the birds, the inhabitants of the ideal city
of Aristophanes.” Lords of their own will and time, they obey
no laws except the terms of their voluntary engagements.
They fly from war, pestilence, and ruin. When the heavens
darken, they strap up their trunks, go on board a steamer
and journey to other countries where gaiety and gold are to
be found.</p>

<p>The sole disturbance in these careless lives is the question
of engagements. The skill with which they have averted
the difficulties, which their preference for a nomad life might
have produced in their business, is a very remarkable example
of that practical sense which constant travelling develops in
the least cultivated individual.</p>

<p>Dispersed throughout the four quarters of the world, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">[p004]</span> <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> have placed themselves in perpetual communication
with, first, managers and <em class="e000I2">impresarii</em>, and then with their
comrades, by means of a certain number of agencies and
newspapers belonging to their corporation.</p>

<p>The eldest of these publications is <em class="e000I2">The Era</em>, published in
London in English. <em class="e000I2">The Era</em>, now edited by Edward
Ledger, was started in 1837. It is a kind of guide-book,
consisting of twenty-four pages, each containing six columns,
in the usual shape of an English newspaper; the price is
sixpence a copy. In the title the royal escutcheon, supported
by the lion and the unicorn, separates the two words <em class="e000I2">The</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Era</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p005">[p005]</span></p>

<p>Half the newspaper is filled with addresses of this
kind—</p>

<div class="poembox">
<div class="center">Miss FLORENCE WEST.</div>
<div class="center">Address:</div>
<div class="center">10 Elm Tree Road, N.W.</div>
<div class="center">&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;</div>
<div class="center">Miss MINNIE BELL.</div>
<div class="center">Disengaged.</div>
<div class="center">Crystal Palace.</div></div>

<p>All these addresses are arranged in alphabetical order. A
proprietor can at once discover where the “novelty” with
whom he proposes to communicate is temporarily staying.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Era</em> also serves as a letter-box to all its subscribers.
A special department is open under this heading:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>THE <em class="e000I2">ERA</em> LETTER-BOX.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then follows, arranged in columns, an alphabetical list of
the persons for whom a note has been sent to the newspaper
office.</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p><em class="e000I2">Adeson, M.</em></p>
<p><em class="e000I2">Atleyn, Madame.</em></p>
<p><em class="e000I2">Barry, Miss Helen.</em></p>
<p><em class="e000I2">Chelli, Miss Erminia</em>, &#38;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The remainder of the <em class="e000I2">Era</em> is consecrated to artistically-written
accounts of all the new theatrical performances going
on in the world, and naturally to offers of employment and
advertisements for engagements.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary fancies are allowed free play in
the compilation and typographical arrangement of these
advertisements. It is a question of attracting notice at
<span class="xxpn" id="p006">[p006]</span> any price. A clever artist unhesitatingly pays for a whole
column, in which horizontally, diagonally, as a cross, or an
X, he repeats his own name and acquirements three or
four hundred times.</p>

<p>I quote the following specimens, taken at random from
the columns of the <em class="e000I2">Era</em>:</p>

<div class="newspapertext">

<p class="first">A YOUNG MAN, completely disarticulated, wishes to enter into an engagement
with a travelling troupe.</p>

<p>This artist can be described in the placards either as the <em class="e000I2">india-rubber man</em>
or the <em class="e000I2">serpent man</em>. He undertakes the monkey parts in pantomimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="newspapertext">

<p class="first">MISS MAGGIE VIOLETTE (fixed bars) is free from any engagement after
Christmas.</p></div>

<div class="newspapertext">

<p class="first">A FATHER offers to managers a young girl, fourteen years old, who has only
one eye, placed above the nose, and one ear on the shoulder.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Era</em> has an American rival also published in English,
<em class="e000I2">The New York Mirror</em>. This newspaper has only one
advantage over the <em class="e000I2">Era</em>: it publishes portraits.</p>

<p>Germany, however, possesses two newspapers for the
<em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>: one, under a French title, <em class="e000I2">La Revue</em>; the other,
which is far the most important, is called <em class="e000I2">Der Artist</em>. The
complete sub-title is: <em class="e000I2">Central-Organ zur Vermittlung des
Verkehrs zwischen Directoren und Künstlern der Circus,
Varietebühnen, reisenden Theater und Schaustellungen</em>. This
paper is printed at Düsseldorf; M. C. Krauss is the chief
editor.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Der Artist</em> has been established six years. It looks like
a weekly review of twenty leaves, printed in three columns.
A woodcut, which fills the frontispiece and all the left side
of the first page, represents various scenes from the circus
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">[p008]</span> and theatres: “shootists” breaking bottles, horses leaping
over bars, pretty equestrians on their highly-trained steeds,
tame lions, dwarfs, giants, clowns,—all the attractions of the
circus and fair.</p>

<p>Here, as in the <em class="e000I2">Era</em>, we find long alphabetical enumerations
of travelling and stationary establishments and lists of
addresses of artists engaged or disengaged. These advertisements
are nearly all compiled in an extraordinary
gibberish, which far surpasses the ingenuity of the “sabir”:
here is a specimen of them, the first I met with. It is a
curious mixture of French, English, Latin, Italian, and
German words:</p>

<div class="newspapertext">

<p class="first">MISS ADRIENNE ANCIOU, la reine de l’air, la plus grande Équilibriste
aérienne de l’Époque,—Nec plus ultra—senza Rival, frei ab August 1888,
28 East 4. Str. New York.</p></div>

<p>It is very remarkable that English and American puffing
has quite disappeared here. The earnestness and application
of the German character are betrayed even in the typographical
arrangement of this newspaper for acrobats. It is as
clearly and carefully printed as a catalogue of the Leipzic
libraries. The biographical notices, announcements of death,
column of accidents, the <em class="e000I2">Varietebühnen</em> are compiled with
scrupulous care and exactitude. This curious publication
even finds space for literature, and the last number of the
<em class="e000I2">Artist</em> published as a supplement <em class="e000I2">Damons Walten</em>, a novel,
by Otto von Ellendorf. It is easy to appreciate the services
which these and similar newspapers are able to confer upon
the <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="450" height="647" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“To tell the truth,” one of the confraternity said to me one
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">[p010]</span> day, “in the whole world we have no other home but the
little pigeon-hole of advertisements, where those who know
us go and ask for news of us, where they learn the history
of our engagements, our successes, our accidents, our
marriage, the birth of our children, or the tidings of our
death.”</p>

<p>Between the artist who seeks for an engagement and
the manager always on the look out for an extraordinary
“novelty,” a third person necessarily intervenes, the middleman,
who arises everywhere between buyer and seller.</p>

<p>And, in fact, at the present time all the principal cities
of the world have their agents for performing artists of every
kind. These personages are very important, and make large
profits. Those best known on the Continent are Messrs.
Paravicini and Warner, of London; Hitzig and Wulff, of
Berlin; Wild, of Vienna; Rosinsky, of Paris; Nael Salsbury,
of New York, who, during the Exhibition of 1889, has shown
the Parisians the savage life of the “Wild West,” transported
to Paris in the persons of the celebrated Buffalo-Bill and his
Indians.</p>

<p>The history of the Rosinsky agency is worth narration, for
it is now so flourishing that it has replaced, to the advantage
of Paris, the engagement market which formerly existed in
London.</p>

<p>You can imagine that a man would not open an agency of
this kind without first passing through many vicissitudes, and,
in fact, R. Rosinsky has had a most checkered life.</p>

<p>He first acquired a taste for the profession through
frequenting Barnum’s show in the United States. He has
been manager of several American troupes, and proprietor of
<span class="xxpn" id="p011">[p011]</span> a theatre, alternately at St. Louis de Missouri and New
York. His affairs prospered, and, with the aid of a partner,
Rosinsky opened a circus, which he intended to run during
the whole time that the Exhibition at Cincinnati was open,
when an unforeseen accident ruined him.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
<div class="caption">R. ROSINSKY.</div>
</div>

<p>One evening his partner’s son, a young man twenty-five
years old, but deaf and dumb, almost a brute, yet robust and
dangerous, attempted to force an entrance into the dressing-room
of an equestrian, who was just changing her dress after
rehearsal. A policeman was quickly sent for. The deaf-mute
drew a revolver from his pocket, fired at the policeman,
and killed him on the spot.</p>

<p>The consequences of this murder may be easily guessed;
<span class="xxpn" id="p012">[p012]</span> the circus was closed. R. Rosinsky was ruined, and he
recommenced his wanderings.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption">M. SARI.<br />
Founder of the Folies-Bergères.
</div>
</div>

<p>A few months later the famous Brigham Young invited
him to undertake the management of the Theatre of the
Mormons. I still have a copy of the newspaper—<em class="e000I2">The Salt
Lake Daily Herald</em>—in which is found dated “Saturday
morning, May 22, 1875,” an advertisement thus worded:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<p class="center"><em class="e000I2">Salt Lake Theatre</em></p>
<p class="center">R. Rosinsky&#160;&#160;.&#160;&#160;.&#160;&#160;.&#160;&#160;.&#160;&#160;Manager</p>
<p class="center">GRAND MATINÉE THIS EVENING</p>
<p class="center">The Wonderful</p>
<p class="center">JACKLEY FAMILY.</p>
<p class="center">Acrobats and Gymnasts.</p>
</div>

<p>Engaged <span class="xxpn" id="p013">[p013]</span> during the course of the same year by Sari, the
founder of the Folies Bergères, R. Rosinsky crossed the sea
with the Jackley Family.</p>

<p>He was immediately struck by the small number of “stars”
known in Paris, and, in order to attract them, he founded an
agency for artists in 1875. His business has increased so
rapidly that the Rosinsky agency is now in communication
with correspondents scattered through all the great cities of
Europe and the world. One fact is enough to prove the
extent of this business. The annual postal expenses of the
firm exceed 10,000 francs (£400).</p>

<p>An agent of this kind receives 10 per cent, upon every
engagement which he arranges. To prevent any disputes
in collecting this fee a clause is inserted in the agreements
to the effect that the agent’s percentage is to be deducted
by the manager himself from the salary remitted to the
artist at the end of the first month, and these salaries are,
sometimes, very considerable.</p>

<p>In order to compare the amount formerly paid to circus
artists with the sums now received by them, I have consulted
an old manuscript from the archives of M. Franconi,
which bears the title of <em class="e000I2">Registre personnel du Cirque</em>, and
dates back for fifty years.</p>

<p>We find that in 1838 the equestrians Auriol, Lalanne the
elder, Lalanne (Pierre), Lalanne (Paul), Lalanne (Joseph),
were paid, the first-named 500 francs (£20), the others 250
francs <em class="e000I2">per fortnight</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1" id="p014">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="365" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">M. VICTOR FRANCONI.</div>
</div>

<p>The star equestrian, Mdlle. Lucie Linski, then received
300 francs, her companions 100, 50, and even 25 francs per
fortnight. <span class="xxpn" id="p015">[p015]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
<div class="caption">P. T. BARNUM.</div>
</div>

<p>Four years later, in 1842, Auriol, whose success evidently
increased, found his salary doubled. He received 1,000 francs
per fortnight, or 2,000 francs per month, and the equestrian,
Mdlle. Lilianne, 700 francs. Now, a good pad equestrian
often receives 2,000 francs per month; a vaulting clown
1,500 francs; a family of acrobats 3,000 or 4,000 francs;
and a single artist, whose performance is extraordinary and
unusual, receives from 700 to 7,000 francs. Even these
prices have been surpassed at times. Dr. Carver, the great
“shootist,” was paid 15,000 francs a month at the Folies
Bergères. Léotard, at his <em class="e000I2">début</em>, signed engagements for six
months, and received 100,000 francs. The two brothers
Lockhart, whom the Rosinsky agency had sent to India as
<span class="xxpn" id="p016">[p016]</span> clowns, returned as elephant-trainers, and now each of them,
with his beast, earns about 70,000 francs per annum.</p>

<p>The enumeration of these sums tends, I admit, to only one
object—to fill the public with respect, and make it understand
that a good acrobat is, in his own line, quite as exceptional
a being as, for instance, M. Renan is in his. I intentionally
name the learned historian in preference to many other great
intellects, because, in his wisdom, he is certainly convinced
that acrobatic feats are not less useful than exegesis in the
recreation of mankind.</p>

<p>I was led a short time ago, <em class="e000I2">à propos</em> of the manager
Rosinsky, to mention Barnum—P. T. Barnum, the legendary
man whose name, in every language spoken upon the surface
of the globe, serves as an amplified superlative to the positive
<em class="e000I2">impresario</em>.</p>

<p>To write a book upon the <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> and omit to celebrate
Barnum in it would be equivalent to erasing the venerated
name of the Prophet from a commentary on the Koran.</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, now recall the chief events in the
biography of Phineas Taylor Barnum. The man who has
converted the “American Circus” into a national institution
of the New World was born in 1810 in the village of Bethel
in Connecticut.</p>

<p>He is, therefore, now in his eightieth year. I refer those
readers who may be curious about the details of this
adventurous life to a book which P. T. Barnum himself
wrote for the edification of his admirers (<em class="e000I2">The Life of P. T.
Barnum</em>: New York, 1885), and also to another work, which
was published simultaneously in Paris and New York in 1865,
under the title of <em class="e000I2">Les Blagues de L’Univers</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p017">[p017]</span></p>

<p>I pass over the exodus of the youthful ploughboy who
quitted the farm to become the editor of a newspaper, and
will only dwell upon the patriarch, who is ending his life in
the village of Bridgeport (Conn.) with all the splendour of
the setting sun. There, as far as eye can reach, Barnum’s
gaze rests upon his own property only. To him belong the
village, farms, and workshops, the 1,200 workmen, who labour
incessantly, perfecting the materials of the circus, which special
trains convey through the American continent, perpetually
travelling from one ocean to the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
<div class="caption">J. A. BAILLY.<br />
Barnum’s partner and son-in-law.</div>
</div>

<p>The law endeavoured to oppose the free passage of these
trains over the public railroads. Barnum, <em class="e000I2">through economy</em>, at
<span class="xxpn" id="p018">[p018]</span> once
proposed
to construct
new
lines for
his private use
by the side of
those already existing.
Should the idea of
visiting Europe during the Paris Exhibition occur to him,
he would wish to acquire the <em class="e000I2">Great Eastern</em> to carry his
apparatus, men and animals. The tent which covers his
circus is alone worth 30,000 francs (£1,200); it is twice as
large as the Hippodrome in Paris, and can shelter 15,000
spectators. In one day it can be erected, a performance
given, and the journey renewed. The daily receipts vary
between 40,000 and 60,000 francs.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Barnum’s cashiers, although installed in cars containing tills
and writing-tables, have no time to keep any books. The
daily receipts are forwarded uncounted to Bridgeport in sealed
barrels, which are really measures of capacity for gold, silver,
and copper coin. The accounts are all kept at Bridgeport.
<span class="xxpn" id="p019">[p019]</span></p>

<p>A crowd of parasites follows Barnum on his travels and
dwells round his tent. A town springs up in a few hours;
people throng to it from fifty miles round. But then the
arrival of the <em class="e000I2">impresario</em> king has been preceded for some
months by immense descriptive placards posted in the
localities through which his troupe would pass.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One anecdote taken from a thousand is a good example
of the advantages which Barnum has derived from advertisements.</p>

<p>Some years ago a negro, having obtained a reward as a
violinist at the Paris Conservatoire of Music, Barnum concluded
an engagement with him by telegram for one year
at a salary of 40,000 dollars. The walls of New York were
<span class="xxpn" id="p020">[p020]</span> then immediately covered with placards depicting a negro
playing the violin, but without any descriptive words attached
to the picture.</p>

<p>His <em class="e000I2">virtuoso</em> arrived, and Barnum hastened to produce
him. The Yankees came, listened, applauded, but did not
send their friends. What could Barnum do to rouse their
dormant curiosity? He told his workmen to paste the
figure of the negro upside down. This ingenious device was
crowned with success. Perhaps the audience who flocked to
hear him during three consecutive years fancied that a negro
would be exhibited to them—a laureate from the Paris Conservatoire,
who would play the violin whilst balanced on his
head. Whatever their idea may have been, they went in
millions; and this anecdote is not less characteristic of the
peculiar stamp of American curiosity than of Barnum’s genius
for puffing.</p>

<p>It is also an interesting proof of the share which advertisements
play in the success of an entertainment. The artist
world has learnt to appreciate the extraordinary effect of
these coloured placards, and willingly spends a large sum of
money in procuring the most effective designs; and these
advertisements—of which I have reproduced a few of the
most typical—are so varied and so brilliant that they might
fairly dazzle collectors. The finest are issued by the firms
of David Allen and Sons of Belfast, Mr. Barlow of Glasgow,
Adolphe Friedlander of Hamburg, and Charles and Emile
Levy of Paris.</p>

<p>This is the general outline of the organization: of the
<em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>, who travel round the world without a country
and without home ties.
<span class="xxpn" id="p021">[p021]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="571" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p022">[p022]</span>
I must now speak of a less adventurous mountebank—the
Frenchman, who never
willingly travels either
by railroad or steamer,
and who for centuries—for
generations—has contentedly
jogged along in a caravan
from one fair to
another, making
in this way his
eternal tour of
France.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="600" height="794" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The origin of all these troupes of mountebanks, of every
<span class="xxpn" id="p023">[p023]</span> one of these travelling shows, is lost in the mist of ages. At
what epoch were founded the <em class="e000I2">Théâtre Vivien</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Théâtre de
Saint-Antoine</em>, the theatres of the <em class="e000I2">Enfer</em> and of the <em class="e000I2">Physicien
Delisle</em>? In what century did Mouza-ba-baloued first turn
his prophetic wheel under the awning of his caravan? I
assure you that it is beyond the recollections of grandchildren
or of their grandfathers. At all events, it is certain that from
our birth we feel some curiosity mingled with a delicious
dread of the mountebank, the picturesque wanderer, who
passes our home at the same date in every year—like the
migratory birds—who disappears one morning, without any
one knowing where he has gone, or even with any certainty
where he has come from; an ambiguous individual whom
travellers on the high road pass as evening falls, encamped
on the wayside, his kettle installed on a heap of stones, his
thin steed munching the dusty grass, his half naked children
wandering round the caravan, whilst the light shining through
the little red curtains in the window throws the semblance
of a plash of blood on the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This is the rear-guard, the voluntary laggard, the hermit,
who wishes to remain alone until the end. He has not
changed any of the customs of his ancestors, preferring to
<span class="xxpn" id="p024">[p024]</span> separate from his comrades rather than conform to new
ways. His comrades have therefore renounced him. They
will not drag such miscreants in their rear, now that they
form a corporation with charters and statutes publicly
decreed.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the present moment the showmen’s world, like all other
societies composed of rich and poor, is divided into two great
disputing parties. Each of these divisions has its own newspaper,
its representatives, the managers of its interests, its
public opposition meetings. On one side you will find a
group of all the important men in the profession, the proprietors
of large establishments—who have serious interests
to defend. These gentlemen are the anxious guardians of
wealth, amassed with much trouble and labour. The
authorities, who wish for the success of the “local fairs,”
show special favour to these influential <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> in the
allotment of space. From this undue preference, extraordinary
hatred, savage jealousy, result on the part of the
smaller folk, whose sole fortune consists of one van, the
sellers of <em class="e000I2">gaufres</em> and fried potatoes, the owners of swings
and rifle saloons, lotteries, shows, and halls of mystery.</p>

<p>The less important men were the first to organize
<span class="xxpn" id="p025">[p025]</span> themselves.
This is already the sixth year of publication of the
<em class="e000I2">Voyageur Forain</em>,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the organ of the syndical chamber of
<em class="e000I2">forain</em> travellers, a fortnightly newspaper, published on the
1st and 15th of each month. A notice, always placed above
the leading article, informs the readers that “the syndical
chamber of <em class="e000I2">forain</em> travellers admits into its ranks all those,
whether rich or poor, who honourably earn their livelihood
by instructing or amusing the public, or by retail trade.”</p>

<div class="caption">M. HOUCKE.<br />

</div>

<p>The office of this picturesque newspaper is situated in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p026">[p026]</span> Boulevard Henri IV., at the end of a courtyard, above a
stable. There I found an extraordinary Bohemian smoking
a short pipe, lengthened by a quill, who in himself formed
the whole editorial staff of the <em class="e000I2">Voyageur Forain</em>. This man
of letters edits the notices of the Fairs, the Correspondence,
and all the technical part of the newspaper. The rest of
the number is composed of articles by the members of the
syndical council. They consist chiefly of diatribes, directed
against the party of “bourgeois,” who form a separate band,
written in forcible language, which renders them most
amusing to any one interested in French slang.</p>

<p>The “bourgeois,” whose names I find at the head of the
first number of the newspaper of the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em>, dated
May 8, 1887, were, at the time when the society was
instituted:</p>

<p>President: M. François Bidel, manager-proprietor of a
large zoological establishment, <em class="e000I2">Chevalier de la Valeur
civile Italienne</em>.</p>

<p>Vice-presidents: M. J. B. Revest, manufacturer, part-proprietor:
boats (sea on land); M. Ferdinand Corvi,
proprietor and manager of a (miniature) circus.</p>

<p>I will skip the treasurers and directors, and quote part of
the address given to the subscribers to the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em>
in the programme number:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In France, men have fallen into the habit of regarding the <em class="e000I2">forain</em> as a being
apart, at the outside worthy of pity.</p>

<p>However, if we consult our memoirs we shall find that in all ages and in
every place great appreciation has been shown for the high moral qualities of
this population, which, it is true, leads a peculiar existence, but one which is
very honest and perfectly honourable.</p>

<p>Are not these men clever, who group as by magic whole cities within the
city itself—cities of pleasure, filled with attractions of every kind, which the
<span class="xxpn" id="p027">[p027]</span> public hasten to applaud and admire? Are they not men of progress,
these showmen, whose every trick is copied and appropriated in our great
administrations?</p>

<p>In a word, are they not the pioneers of civilization and comfort?</p>

<p>Then why do they appear forsaken? Because they exist only as individuals;
because they considered it impossible to obtain cohesion amongst
themselves; because, in short, they regarded the creation of a great association
as impracticable. The generous assistance of M. Bidel has proved adequate
to lead this important phalange. Resolutely placing himself at the head of
his profession, he said:</p>

<p>“Union is possible; let us unite!”</p></div>

<p>Now, the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em>, which was only founded on the
29th April, 1887, is settled in fine offices in the Rue de
Châteaudun. The association is rich. Its members have
the right to apply to the superannuation fund at the age
of fifty if they have belonged to it for ten years. M. Bidel
looks forward to the day when, in order to invest their funds,
these restless wanderers over the highways of the world will
buy some “house property” in Paris. The <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em>
will have tenants of its own. The showmen will be estate
owners in Paris. And this hope, which will be realized in
a short time, gives the greatest delight to M. Bidel and his
colleagues, particularly when they recall the modest origin of
the association, the meetings held at the Gobelins, in the
menagerie even, where the voices of the orators were
drowned at intervals by the roaring of the wild beasts.
Every month the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em> holds a plenary meeting,
at which the managers submit their accounts to the members.
Every Wednesday the managing committee meets to settle
the business of the week.</p>

<div class="caption">CHADWICK.</div>
</div>

<p>The correspondence is voluminous. Every provincial
member of the society who has had to apply to a local
<span class="xxpn" id="p028">[p028]</span> mayor for a license, or to obtain justice, addresses himself
to the managing committee to solicit its support, and in this
way the showman commands the satisfaction of his claim,
which might otherwise have been refused. The interest
which the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em> takes in his affairs is the highest
recommendation he can have; for it is well known that no
one can belong to the society unless his judicial record is
perfectly clear. One may learn many curious things by
reading the <em class="e000I2">Voyageur forain</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em>. No
one suspects, for instance, that the order of the fairs is
<span class="xxpn" id="p029">[p029]</span> organized in an almost unvarying routine, that has existed
for many centuries, and that it is arranged so as to diminish
as much as possible the expenses of travelling for the
showmen.</p>

<p>In each number of the newspaper you will find the
following intelligence—<em class="e000I2">Indicateur des Foires du Mois</em> (Guide
to the Fairs held this Month). Then follows an alphabetical
list of the departments, with all the items of useful information
quoted in this way:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e000I2">Ain.</em>—1 day: the 2nd, Trévouz, pop. 2,635; the 7th, Marboz, pop. 2,556;

<p>2 days: the 22nd, Lagnieu.</p></div>

<p>Another department, the <em class="e000I2">Review of Fairs and Fêtes</em>, gives
exact information to the subscribers of the paper respecting
the chances of a good sale, and the disadvantages of a
useless removal. The following account of the fair at Sigean
is a specimen of these articles:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“THE FAIR AT SIGEAN (November 6th).</p>

<p>“A small town, 21 kilomètres from Narbonne by road (a railway to La
Nouvelle, 4 kilometres). Business has been extremely bad here, owing to the
unlucky weather and the total ruin of the country. A few years ago this was
one of the most popular fairs amongst showmen, for the inhabitants are fond
of amusement and most sympathetic towards strangers. Space is exceedingly
dear, the price being fixed by the municipality at 25 centimes the square mètre
per diem. It is true that some reductions are granted on this price, but it is
still much too high.</p>

<p>“The following establishments were present: M. Bétriou, Museum of
Progress, and M. Bracco, theatre of performing seals, Place de la Mairie. In
the Rue de Perpignan; Lemaître, mechanical museum; two rifle-saloons;
Cloffulia, decapitation; Mercadier, roundabout; a bear-fight; Gras Chognon,
panorama; lottery bazaars, massacres, and above all, gambling booths, which
enjoy great liberty here, if they can pay well. We saw one roulette-table
which paid 200 frs. for two days, and others in the cafés which paid the
<span class="xxpn" id="p030">[p030]</span> landlord 400 frs. for a single table. This is to be regretted—for such toleration
to gambling is the ruin of all good and honest showmen.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These papers also contain carefully edited accounts of
foreign fairs, such as the following letter sent to the
<em class="e000I2">Voyageur forain</em> from Karkhoff (Russia):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those of our comrades who do not suffer from cold in the eyes, and are
not afraid of being frozen, could try their luck at Karkhoff, where it is only
17 degrees below zero, with 70 centimètres of snow; our friend and correspondent
gives us some interesting details about the customs of the showmen
and people in Russia: thus in most of the cities it is not unusual to see
several shows installed in one booth; for instance, a complete museum of
anatomical figures and groups, a panorama, monkeys, crocodiles, giants,
dwarfs, and armless women, all shown for 20 kopecks, or fivepence, children
and soldiers half-price; no allusion is made to the nurses, or to the treating
propensities of Russian soldiers in love.</p>

<p>“These booths remain in the same town for two or three months at a time;
this year an exhibition was held at Karkhoff, which preceded the fair, and
lasted a fortnight; it consisted of a large museum, a glass-spinner, a large
circus, a fine menagerie, a monkey theatre, and an aquarium, besides the town
<span class="xxpn" id="p031">[p031]</span> theatre; and all these entertainments were established in a city which only
contains 20,000 inhabitants, that is to say, there were too many attractions for
so few people, and no one made any profits; the lower classes are not worth
counting, they devote themselves to the consumption of brandy which brutalizes
them; and only the nobility, the middle classes and the Jews, who are
rather bad than good, can be relied upon. It is impossible to open anything
before noon on Sundays or Thursdays and, we might add, that the Russian
public is utterly <em class="e000I2">blasé</em>, for it has seen nearly every variety of attraction. Still, it
is very fond of marionettes, and the owner of a puppet-theatre, willing to risk a
journey in this country, would soon make his fortune; rents are very dear but
living is cheap, with the exception of wine.”</p></div>

<p>The third page of both the <em class="e000I2">Union mutuelle</em> and the

these columns are particularly amusing. I need scarcely

of skies, curtains, harness, nose-bags, hobby-horses, mermaids,
cars, biscuits, gaufres, sugar-sticks, sweetmeats: of everything
that makes a noise, shines or sparkles; that swings or
turns; that can be eaten or produces a great effect. And
as usual these advertisements amuse us, for we outsiders cannot
bring ourselves to look upon those industries which tend
<span class="xxpn" id="p034">[p034]</span> only to procure objects of amusement for us, in any serious
light.</p>

<p>Most of these articles are manufactured in Germany. The
oldest manufactory of roundabouts of wooden horses is in
Moblitz in Saxe-Weimar, another is in Thuringia. Still,
there are a few French manufacturers in the field, and their
productions, although a little dearer than the German ones,
are much appreciated by showmen, for the good taste which
distinguishes them. M. D———, de Vic Bigorre, (Hautes
Pyrénées,) a celebrated curtain and scene-painter, is one of
these artists. The following notice is added to all his
advertisements—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em class="e00S02">Note.</em>—Himself a child of the fair, M.
D——— is well acquainted with the necessities and style of picture

<p>Another is a specialist for the vans used for carrying plant,
dentists’ cars, breaks for driving parties, caravans, &#38;c.</p>

<p>I saw one of these model caravans at the Fair du Trône;
it contained dining and drawing-rooms, a bedroom and
servant’s room. Through the open window of the drawing-room,
I heard the refrain of one of Métra’s waltzes. I went
nearer and saw that the musician was a charming young girl,
wearing a plush dressing-gown, conscientiously practising
the piano.</p>

<p>I leave you with this vision of middle-class prosperity. I
hope it will correct, as far as may be, the very false ideas
which hitherto you may have cherished about <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> and

<h2 title="Chapter II. The Fair." id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II.
<span class="smaller">THE FAIR.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">Fashion, which regulates our amusements, has decreed
for some years past, that when at Easter time we
direct our steps to the Fair du Trône, our little excursion is
quite “the correct thing.” The faubourgs and suburbs no
longer enjoy the monopoly of the fun collected at the foot of
the two columns, the caps of the swells from Vincennes, and
the hair-nets of the Cytherean bataillon from Montreuil-sous-Bois
are no longer the sole head-dresses visible. The
Gingerbread Fair has its reserved days like the Opera and
the Comédie, and on Tuesdays and Fridays the largest profits
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">[p038]</span> are made. Really, if you strolled in that direction about five
o’clock on one of these select afternoons, you would be
surprised to see the long line of carriages standing in the
Faubourg Saint-Antoine and the Boulevard Voltaire. For
every three cabs, in which a party of students are enjoying
themselves in somewhat noisy fashion with their little
companions, you will find one gentleman’s carriage with
servants in livery, or, at least, a hired victoria occupied by
women in over-smart dresses, who are making their annual
excursion to the fair, accompanied by the “mashers” of the
year. It is curious to watch these society people when they
visit this populous district which they have never seen except
through the windows of mourning carriages on the road to
Père la Chaise, or on the eve of a capital execution, lighted
by the windows of the small taverns in a cruel bustle of
festivity. Secretly, they feel a little uneasy. The too demonstrative
enjoyment, the cries, shouts and songs, the
incessant rattle from the rifle saloons, the explosion of fireworks,
the pushing crowd struggling round the stages of the
various booths, from which the showman harangues the
crowd, recall, in spite of themselves, memories of civil war
and the barricades, and produce a gentle shiver—that shiver
which steals down the spine in front of a wild beast cage,
if the thought occurs to one that the iron bars might give
way, and the lion in his fury be free to rush upon the spectators&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
But in itself, this secret, indefinable misgiving
is rather pleasant, and it is certain that this semi-dread forms
half the pleasure which many pretty women feel in venturing
amongst the crowd and exposing themselves to a somewhat
rough hustling from the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="571" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>However, when we emerge from the shadows of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p039">[p039]</span> boulevard and faubourg into the brilliantly lighted square,
timid hearts regain courage, and we at once catch the infection
of the gaiety surrounding us. Every one is come for
amusement and intends to get it. We see all the
<span class="xxpn" id="p040">[p040]</span> monstrosities,
all the beautiful Circassians, consult all the somnambulists,
and visit all the booths, make excursions in the switchback
railway and take the traditional turn on the roundabouts,
filling up the intervals by breaking pipes, slaughtering marionettes
with balls, and throwing the hammer at the Turk’s
head. And then the late drive back to dinner in the cool
evening air, the slow recovery from the effects of so much
laughter as we roll towards the Boulevards, with paper roses
in our button-holes, the carriage filled with gingerbread from
Rheims, comic figures, symbolic animals, and effigies of Saint
Remo with mitre and crosier, which resemble primitive bas-reliefs
in old oak torn from the stalls of a church choir.</p>

<p>I also make an annual visit to the Gingerbread fair, but not
as a lounger who follows wherever the crowd leads him. I
am accompanied to the Champ du Trône by the best of
guides, one of the most brilliant correspondents of the
<em class="e000I2">Voyageur forain</em> to which I referred just now—M. Philippe,
the editor of the <em class="e000I2">Tir de la Republique</em>.</p>

<p>M. Philippe was formerly a sailor; and has retained from
his sojourn on the men-of-war the naval cut of his beard, and
the cap which he wore during the expedition which he made
to the North, when he saluted the Pole in the neighbourhood
of the Behring Sea. This retired sailor is a very intelligent
man, of a stamp which only flourishes in the atmosphere of
Paris; a gunsmith by profession, the vicissitudes of existence
and a taste for adventure have made him, as a last expedient,
a showman’s journalist.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE SHOW.</div>
</div>

<p>To ensure this excursion passing off with due success, it is
always preceded by a short conference held between two
glasses of beer, in which, elbows on table, my guide gravely
<span class="xxpn" id="p041">[p041]</span> reminds me, that I must be careful to remember the distinction
that exists between the <em class="e000I2">forain</em> and the <em class="e000I2">banquiste</em>, the
<em class="e000I2">grande</em> and the <em class="e000I2">petite banques</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i055.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A <em class="e000I2">forain</em> is technically a merchant, or the owner of a game.
The sweetmeat-maker who, surrounded by a circle of admiring
children, rolls serpentine rings of paste round a
flexible wand laden with little bells is a <em class="e000I2">forain</em>, so is the
fritter merchant; the same term describes the rich agent of
the manufacturers of Rheims and Dijon, who travel round
the world carrying with them the best brands of gingerbread.
The celebrated M. Exaltier, the director of the American
Galleries, is also a <em class="e000I2">forain</em>; by the ingenuity of his inventions
he has revived the public interest in panoramas.
The same term describes the clever M. Chable, the manufacturer
of the finest hygienic horses that have ever been
<span class="xxpn" id="p042">[p042]</span> seen, splendid animals made of varnished poplar wood, stout
as a Flemish mare, which cost him two hundred francs each.</p>

<p>“They were dearer than if they were alive,” cheerfully
repeats M. Chable, caressing his steeds, “but I save it in
the food.”</p>

<p>The post-master of hygienic horses is an important personage
in the <em class="e000I2">forain</em> world, and so is also the proprietor of the
“Crystal Palace,” the most luxurious roundabout of hobby-horses
at present in the Fair du Trône or anywhere else.
His tent contains no less than two organs; one of them
cost him 5,000 fr., the other 12,000 fr. His daily expenses
amount to eighty francs for his establishment; but a fine
Sunday doubles his receipts in a marvellous way, and the
“Crystal Palace,” when all the three <em class="e000I2">sous</em> a ride have been
counted up, often makes a thousand francs in one day.</p>

<p>All the keepers of billiard-tables, the owners of wheels of
fortune or lotteries, are <em class="e000I2">forains</em>. A complete and most
curious book might be written on the fraudulent games of
chance which swarm in a fair, in spite of the vigilance of the
police. I shall write one some day when M. Carrabilliat,
one of the most intelligent and most respected members of
the syndicate, has completed my education. To begin with,
he explained to me the mechanism of his race game, an
amusement which, although forbidden for a time, is now
permitted in the fair since the owners have proved the
impossibility of tampering with the small horses or of preventing
the slight bars upon which they move from turning
freely round the course. The good-natured public more
than suspects some tricks. It knows by experience that the
rabbit is never won at the first shot, and that no one within
<span class="xxpn" id="p043">[p043]</span> the memory of man has ever carried
off the clock with its glass shade. This
fact does not prevent it from paying its
pennies to the owner of the wheel of
fortune, or check its eager competition
with chance as a partner, for the possession
of a little glass chandelier. Here,
as at Monaco, you will find the gambler
who gets excited and ruins himself—alas!
the poor fellow loses all self-restraint
if the bystanders gather round
him, watching and discussing his luck!</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="xxpn" id="p044">[p044]</span></div>
</div>

<p>I, who know all the secrets of the fair, would charitably
whisper to the imprudent gambler that there are always some
accomplices in cant—“stallsmen”—amongst the lookers-on.
These individuals are particularly addicted to loitering near
the rifle saloons, and the games which require strength and
skill. They it is who whisper at your back—</p>

<p>“Well shouldered! a little too low! What a pity! It
would have broken the egg. Stop, Arthur, perhaps the
gentleman will try again.”</p>

<p>The “gentleman” feels flattered, takes some silver from his
pocket, and with an innocent air the proprietor of the saloon
pours twelve caps into his hand.</p>

<p>The rifle-shooting, the hammers, and the rings are all
manly sports. Ladies prefer the hobby-horses and the
swinging-boats. You know what perfection has been attained
in this last amusement for the gratification of those
who, like Hippocrates, believe in the utility of spring
remedies. They clear the system. From this point of
view the new swinging-boats are serious rivals to all quack
medicines. Those who have not travelled round the world
can enjoy in these cars all the spasms of sea-sickness and
every variety of giddiness. In these respects the old system
gave full satisfaction to many worthy people; but it appears
that, compared with the new fashion, like the apparatus in
the Rue Basse du Rempart, the old swings were mere child’s
play. Some travellers descend from this invention in much
the same state as the wolf which Baron Munchausen turned
inside out like a glove! Where will progress stop? But
progress is very inconsiderate when it attempts to substitute
velocipedes and wild beasts for the old hobby-horses. Have
<span class="xxpn" id="p045">[p045]</span> the inventors of these machines never spent one quarter of
an hour in front of the old roundabouts? Have they never
noticed the defiant, haughty glance which the young shopmen
and little milliners throw at you as they pass in the course of
their revolutions?</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Those people are in a dream. For one whole minute they
<span class="xxpn" id="p046">[p046]</span> imagine themselves in a higher sphere, riding in couples
through the woods. Intoxicated by the revolving motion
which, through the necessary bend of the body nails them
to the saddle, they feel like accomplished riders, incomparable
horsewomen. Watch them there, ye pioneers of
a mistaken progress, who have not taken the instincts of
the heart into your calculation and cannot, therefore, understand
the philosophy of hobby-horses! A little attention will
yet avert the failure which threatens your riding-schools of
velocipedes and carnivorous animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i060.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But these are all noisy amusements which the society
people avoid. Do you remember, my dear friend, the drive
we took outside the shows and bands, one fine Easter-Tuesday,
brilliant with sunshine? You dared not leave your brougham,
<span class="xxpn" id="p047">[p047]</span> you were so alarmed at the hoarse roar of the crowd, the
explosion of crackers, the shrieks of the women in the swings.
Still you had one great desire that you would not own to me,
half dreading a reproof, a wish evoked by a most appetizing
odour which made your nostrils dilate.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are longing for some fried potatoes,” I
cried triumphantly at last.</p>

<p>Ah! who would ever forget the glance with which your
eyes rewarded me for guessing your fancy!</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i061.jpg" width="450" height="338" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And, much to the disdain of your English coachman and
footman, both sitting so correctly on the box, I fetched you
some beautiful hot potatoes nicely powdered with salt. And
in your satin-lined <em class="e000I2">coupé</em>, touching them daintily with the
ends of your lavender-gloved fingers, one by one, you ate
them, seasoned with merry laughter.</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>“Oh, Time, arrest thy flight!”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Five o’clock struck: it was the last effort of the fair before
<span class="xxpn" id="p048">[p048]</span> the neighbourhood commenced the evening meal. The clowns
joked and shouted louder than usual; the rattles, gongs,
pipes, drums, speaking-trumpets, barrel-organs, and whistles
of the steam-engines all sounded together in a final tremendous
discord. Through the clamour, the crowd, eddying like
a stream, ascended the Avenue de Vincennes, going towards
the columns erected on the spot where the fire took place.</p>

<p>Between them, the disk of the setting sun was shining like
the Pyx upon an altar. And as it suddenly disappeared
behind the hill, a cry rose in the air, stifled, agonizing, which
threw you trembling upon my shoulder—a cry which pierced
above all the clamour of machinery and men—the captive
lion’s farewell to the darkened sun!</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to imagine that all fairs are alike.
Each of them, although composed of the same booths,
assumes such a different character from the locality where it
is installed and the people who frequent it, that any one
interested in such matters, like myself, could easily make a
bet, that carried blindfolded into the midst of any local festival,
when his eyes were uncovered, he could at the first glance
distinguish which fair was being celebrated. And he could
tell, simply through seeing the visitors, who thronged it, and
by inspecting the stalls.</p>

<p>Look, for instance, at the old fair held at Versailles, the
fair of Saint Louis, which, annually, in the heart of August,
placards on the doors of the railway stations, between the lists
of circular excursions and the advertisements of summer
pleasures, long descriptions of its attractions: water-jousts,
fanfares of horns sounded through the alleys of the park,
display of fountains in the Neptune basin, shows accompanied
<span class="xxpn" id="p049">[p049]</span> by big drums, the music of the roundabouts, the gaiety of the
little booths, side by side with the great empty palace. Is it
through the immense width of the alleys that the noise of the
bands seems scattered and lost? Or can it be a secret dread
of disturbing the king’s slumbers, which still haunts all these
small folk, and causes them to subdue the rough music of their
orchestras?</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Surrounded by barriers, this agglomeration of diminutive
white shops resembles a flock of timid sheep huddling close
together, not venturing to ring their bells too loudly through
fear of the wolf. Here, too, are stalls of rosaries, holy-water
vases, and crucifixes, recalling the sacred origin of the fair.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i064.jpg" width="250" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>No doubt you will recognize the same faces that you have
<span class="xxpn" id="p050">[p050]</span> seen everywhere else; the same brightly painted caravans,
with small muslin curtains in the windows; the same gaufre-seller,
mixing the same paste, in the same moulds, with the
same gesticulations; and lastly the same horrible trumpery,
utterly devoid of any originality: blue-eyed dolls, miniature
Zouaves, sixpenny knives, imitation tortoise-shell frames,
rabbits playing the drum, reed pipes, and brass trumpets.
No one knows why workmen are so entirely bereft of imagination
or self-respect as to persevere in the manufacture of
these inferior toys for at least a hundred years; yet these
“fairings” travel all over the world. You will find them in
Algiers as soon as you land; on the threshold of Asia, at
Constantinople, shops full of this rubbish are installed side by
side with bazaars for Turkish carpets; the ships which bring
from Japan the delicious knicknacks which fill our houses,
<span class="xxpn" id="p051">[p051]</span> return to the far East laden with cargoes of plush frames and
rabbits playing drums.</p>

<p>But the idiosyncrasy which distinguishes Versailles and its
neighbourhood, the chosen retreat of literary men and elderly
magistrates, is the presence of the dealer in old books who
annually attends this fair. From a little distance the reddish-brown
covers of his wares resemble gingerbread paving-stones.
Men in spectacles bend lovingly over the stall, the
scent of mouldy leather gently tickling their nostrils.</p>

<p>And every year there is one stall at which a woman sells
false hair by the pound. Hanging round like horses’ tails,
side by side, these poor tresses, collected from the gutter and
the hospital, produce a tragic effect. One anxiously wonders
where all these dull-looking plaits come from; who will wear
them next? One day I lingered about for some time,
waiting to see if a customer would appear.</p>

<p>At last a woman drew near.—Ageless, in mourning, basket
in hand, unclassable; yet evidently not a happy woman. At
first she dared not pause, then she regained courage.</p>

<p>“How much is that?”</p>

<p>“Five francs.”</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is too fair for me. Can you see what I want?” And
she raised her veil from her face.</p>

<p>At length she passed on without buying. There was
nothing grey enough for her.</p>

<p>The fair at Versailles is a provincial fair, a fair patronized
by grandfathers and grandchildren, nursemaids and soldiers.</p>

<p>The typical Parisian fair, the <em class="e000I2">chic</em> fair, is held at Neuilly.</p>

<p>In April, when the Avenue de Vincennes, the Boulevard
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">[p052]</span> Voltaire, and the Faubourg Saint Antoine are decorated with
rows of white stalls, the cold winter wind still sweeps over
the earth, rushes through the wide streets, carrying with it
clouds of dust, blusters through the fair, filling the canvas of
the booths like sails on the sea, powdering the gingerbread
stalls as it passes; then in rough leaps, as though driven by a
whip, forms dusty columns in the air, and rising several feet
above the ground triumphantly waves the flags above the
booths and roundabouts.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i066.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It makes the evenings too chilly for sauntering about, hands
in pocket, under the illuminations produced by the waving
<span class="xxpn" id="p053">[p053]</span> lanterns and the flickering gaslights! one feels too cold to
care for amusement or refreshments. And therefore when
after dinner the frequenters of the <em class="e000I2">cafés</em> on the boulevards
hail the club <em class="e000I2">coupés</em>, they never dream, as the door is closed
on the still wintry toilettes of their companions, of saying to
the coachman, “To the Fair du Trône.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They turn to the concerts and the circus. There is too much
chilly darkness, too long a drive through the deserted boulevards,
between the dinner and the suburban <em class="e000I2">fête</em>. The exhilaration
produced by champagne and laughter would die on the way.</p>

<p>Neuilly is the evening fair. It opens in the heart of summer,
<span class="xxpn" id="p054">[p054]</span> in the full tide of that excessive heat which renders the
drawing-room and theatre equally unbearable to those
Parisians who wait for the month of August before they go
to the sea, and who live in tea-gowns, fan in hand, sipping
ices and lemons, behind their closed Venetian shutters. Like
passengers in the tropics, who watch for the setting sun before
they go on deck, these pretty women reclining in their bamboo
chairs, impatiently follow the course of the clock-hands, so
slowly travelling towards five o’clock. At that hour they
get up, and in the semi-light of the dressing-room, with
lowered blinds and wide-open windows, they leisurely array
themselves in fresh and scented toilettes. They are going to
dine in the open air, on the terrace of some restaurant in the
Bois. Capes and mantles are too heavy during this month,
and a young woman can go out without any wrap hiding her
charming dress; she only carries a small shawl and one of
those parasols, which, itself brilliant as a flower, enhances the
effect of the whole toilette and, whilst intercepting the sun’s
rays, throws most becoming shadows on the face.</p>

<p>Then about six o’clock, at the doors of the Ministries and
all along the Quai d’Orsay, a line of light, open carriages
may be seen, in which young women have come to fetch
husband or lover, soothing their impatience for the hour of
freedom by noting the admiring glances of the passers-by.
And when at last the lingerers appear in grey hat, white waistcoat,
short coat and smart buttonhole, the couples lounging back
in their carriages, drive through the Avenue des Champs
Elysées, towards the summer restaurants and the shade of
the Bois. The Pavillon d’Armenonville reaps the greatest
<span class="xxpn" id="p055">[p055]</span> advantages from the vicinity of the fair. The orchestra of
the Tzigane Rigo, hidden in the gardens of the pavillon, first
attracts the notice of the passers-by; they draw near, lean
over the hedge, and look in to see if any one is seated at the
little tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter size5">
<img src="images/i069.jpg" width="190" height="380" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“See, there is so-and-so, and so-and-so, C——— and B———.”
Political and literary men, artists, financiers, women of both
worlds, the recognized and the unrecognized, the Luxembourg,
the Palais Bourbon, the theatre, the newspapers, the drawing-room,
and boudoirs. The guests seat themselves under the
verandah, to watch the carriages drive up. The table-napkins
are dazzling in their snowy whiteness against the green leafy
trees, the ice melts in the silver bowls, and the freshly cut
cucumbers resemble aquatic leaves, torn from the pond of
<span class="xxpn" id="p056">[p056]</span> water lilies, which we only glimpse at through the hanging
branches of the willows.</p>

<p>Hours pass pleasantly, languidly, in this festive scene. The
Rakoczy March, the Stephanie Gavotte, give a tinge of
gallantry and love to the reverie into which we fall, daydreams
vague as the outlines of the landscape before us.</p>

<p>And the spell lasts, until suddenly, lights, which are not
reflected from the stars, appear mirrored in the waters of the
tiny lake. They shine from the red lamps of the victorias
now being lighted.</p>

<p>Night has fallen.</p>

<p>It is time to go to the fair.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter III. Permanent Shows or Entresorts." id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III.
<span class="smaller">PERMANENT SHOWS OR ENTRESORTS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The visit to the fair usually commences by the <em class="e000I2">entresorts</em>,
or permanent shows.</p>

<p>What are <em class="e000I2">entresorts</em>?</p>

<p>I must again quote my friend Philip, the ancient mariner,
whom I introduced to you just now, at the present moment
editor of the <em class="e000I2">Tir de la Republique</em>, municipal councillor, and
editorial secretary to the <em class="e000I2">Voyageur Forain</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size5">
<img src="images/i072.jpg" width="190" height="380" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“In the cant idiom used by the <em class="e000I2">petite banque</em>, we describe
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">[p058]</span> by the name of <em class="e000I2">entresort</em> any booth which contains a permanent
show without beginning or end, an establishment
which <em class="e000I2">the public only walks through</em>. Waxworks are <em class="e000I2">entresorts</em>,
so are exhibitions of dwarfs, monstrosities, learned fleas,
and tattooed women. The booths which contain catch-pennies,
somnambulists, conjuring tricks, fat women, and pretty girls,
are also <em class="e000I2">entresorts</em> if you like, but they are more frequently
termed <em class="e000I2">Halls of Mystery</em>—I need scarcely tell you why.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i073.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p><em class="e000I2">Entresorts</em> and Halls of Mystery always swarm in every
fair. They are cheap amusements largely patronized by the
<span class="xxpn" id="p059">[p059]</span> crowd. And whilst the more important shows have changed all
their entertainments and have introduced unlimited improvements
into their theatres, the <em class="e000I2">entresort</em> has not altered either
its arrangements or its exhibition since the origin of time. It
is always established in a canvas booth, sometimes provided
with wooden benches lighted by four oil lamps; while the
show is usually of an alarming nature—scenes from the
<span class="xxpn" id="p060">[p060]</span> Inquisition, executions, heads of celebrated murderers, exhibitions
of monstrosities, of five-footed sheep, armless artists,
calves’ heads, giants and dwarfs.</p>

<p>No one should wonder at the fact that many people are
more interested in the abnormal than in the beautiful. But
this trait being once recognised, the dwarf is more wonderful
than the giant; man is such a complicated machine, that in
watching these microscopic creatures who gesticulate and
speak like ourselves, we feel something of the same astonishment
that would strike us if we found the seconds marked by
a miniature watch which we could only see through a magnifying
glass. For this reason the dwarf show is one of the
most popular booths in the fair.</p>

<p>Every one knows that there are two kinds of dwarfs—those
who are naturally dwarfs, and those who, as children,
were at first of average size and growth, but whose development
was abruptly checked. In their case the limbs which
no longer grew, were yet capable of enlargement. As a rule
the head is enormous. Monsieur François, from the Cirque
Franconi—the partner of Billy Hayden the clown, the tiny
circus rider—is a typical specimen of this class of dwarfs, who
are called <em class="e000I2">noués</em> to distinguish them from the perfect miniature
of humanity. They are physically deformed, but in all other
respects they resemble other men. François, for instance, is
very intelligent. I shall always remember our first interview
two years ago in Erminia Chelli’s box at the Cirque d’Eté.</p>

<p>“How old are you, Monsieur François?”</p>

<p>“Twenty.”</p>

<p>“I am older than you are, M. François; yet, as you know,
I am not celebrated.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p061">[p061]</span></p>

<p>M. François shook his head, and as a consolation—“you see
not every one can be a dwarf”—he gravely answered:</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="340" height="680" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Do not pity yourself, sir; you are distinguished for your
learning.”</p>

<p>Since then M. François has told me all about his present
life. He lives at Villette with his mother, whom he supports.
In the evening, as the distance is too great for his short legs,
<span class="xxpn" id="p062">[p062]</span> he goes out by the last omnibus, and even when the vehicle is
full, he is charged for his place.</p>

<p>“Yet I take so little room, sir!”</p>

<p>M. François is a brave lad; and those who have seen him
in his Cordovan boots, driving his team of six horses, know
that he is an exceptionally good whip. It should though be
noticed, that however deficient the <em class="e000I2">noués</em> may be in size, they
possess the same intelligence and sometimes the full strength
of a man of normal height. In 1802 Germany possessed a
clever painter named Jacob Lehnen, who was exactly 3 ft.
10 in. high; and I read in an English newspaper, the <em class="e000I2">Daily
Advertiser</em>, dated 18th August, 1740, an announcement of
the arrival at a London tavern, the <em class="e000I2">Great Glass</em>, of a Persian
dwarf called the <em class="e000I2">Second Samson</em>, only 3 ft. 8 in., who carried
two strong men at arm’s-length and danced between the
tables with his double burden.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i076.jpg" width="340" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These deformities are not attacked by the decrepitude
which prevents their comrades from living beyond their
<span class="xxpn" id="p063">[p063]</span> twentieth or twenty-fifth year. There are historical instances
of centenarian <em class="e000I2">noués</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1819, at the Court Theatre, a <em class="e000I2">noués</em> was exhibited aged
sixty-three; her name was Thérèse Souvary, and according
to the advertisements, she was betrothed in her youth to
Bébé, a dwarf belonging to good King Stanislaus. And if
these advertisements were untrue, there are proofs in other
places of a great many marriages contracted by dwarfs, who
have had large families. M. Edward Garnier, in his curious
pathological study of the <em class="e000I2">noués</em>, quotes the case of the painter
dwarf Gibson, who married a wife as small as himself and
had nine children by her, of whom five were of average
height and attained manhood. Two other dwarfs, married in
London, Robert and Judith Kinner, had fourteen children all
well made and robust. Lastly, any one may have seen in the
Western papers in 1883, the notice of the death at Sables
d’Olonne, of a little dwarf long exhibited in fairs under the
<span class="xxpn" id="p064">[p064]</span> name of the <em class="e000I2">Petite Nine</em>. This tiny creature, who was not
more than 31½ inches high, married a M. Callias and had
several children by him. She had even survived the
Cesarean operation, and reached a great age notwithstanding
her scandalous insobriety.</p>

<p>In spite of the intelligence of the <em class="e000I2">noués</em> I quite understand
why no one becomes devoted to them; but it is quite another
thing with regard to natural dwarfs who, whilst remarkable for
their extremely small size, yet retain in their miniature forms
the æsthetic beauty of proportion. All Europe has seen in the
circus or in the fairs, one couple of these elegant dwarfs, General
Mite and Miss Millie Edwards, whom Barnum launched upon
the world under the name of the <em class="e000I2">American Midgets</em>.</p>

<p>If we may believe the manager who superintends the
travels of the Midgets, they are both American citizens.
Their respective families advertised their matrimonial requirements—a
young man of six inches wishing for a suitable
wife, and a young girl of five inches wishing for a husband
of six; they journeyed towards each other across the world,
and were married at Manchester.</p>

<p>The Midgets have prospered in worldly matters. They
are engaged at a very high salary of some thousands of
francs per month, and will be able to provide handsomely
for any children that Heaven may send them. Their
dress and food cost them very little. The “General”
usually dines upon half a biscuit and a few carefully-measured
drops of wine. He is marvellously jealous of his wife, and
when I once advanced to her carriage to help her to alight,
Mr. Mite pretty curtly informed me in English that he kept
a footman on purpose to attend to her.
<span class="xxpn" id="p065">[p065]</span></p>

<p>But it appears that the General is not only jealous, he is
also fickle: he had brilliant success in England. I tried to
make him talk about it, but like an honourable man, he was
mute upon the subject, and his present <em class="e000I2">impresario</em> told me
that he had often attempted to sound him upon the point,
but had met with no better success than I had done.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i079.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>General Mite sings the tambour-major’s song extremely
well; manages a “sociable” tricycle like a professional, and
waltzes gracefully. The General is very brisk, very lively, a
wonderful mimic; he acts several little pieces with real
talent—amongst others, a scene of drunkenness, and the
promenade of a New York dandy.</p>

<p>But neither the General nor his wife possess the same
charm as Princess Paulina. I have been quite close to this
wonderful little creature and taken her by the hand, which,
like the whole of her person, is modelled with infinite delicacy.
<span class="xxpn" id="p066">[p066]</span> She might be taken for a waxen statuette, a tiny dancer from
Tanagra freshly exhumed, with a little carmine still clinging
to her lips, a little gold to her tunic.</p>

<p>One might apply to Princess Paulina the same praises
which Loret, in 1653, addressed in his “Gazette” to “a
little dwarf belonging to Mademoiselle,” who was suffering
from a cold on the chest produced by the slamming of a
door—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>“Jamais près de Roy ny de Prince<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>“Princess Paulina,” says the voluble individual who advertises
her to the public, “is eleven years old. She is of
Dutch origin, and measures 15¾ inches, and weighs ten
pounds; she is introduced by her brother who is with her.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And the robust stripling lifts the little doll like an ounce:
he holds out one arm and, in the pleasantest manner, the little
princess performs a few acrobatic feats over it. She is very
<span class="xxpn" id="p068">[p068]</span> proud of this little social talent. When I was introduced to
her behind the scenes, she courteously said:</p>

<p>“Shall I turn a somersault for monsieur?”</p>

<p>And in an instant she was standing on her hands, head
down, feet in air, like a clown. With her tiny dress of coral-coloured
muslin and satin flying out around her, Princess
Paulina did not look any larger than a bouquet of roses
enveloped in white paper.</p>

<p>I asked her all the questions that etiquette requires when
speaking to a dwarf.</p>

<p>“Princess Paulina, have you a doll?”</p>

<p>“As large as this, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>She raised her hand above her head, but even then it only
reached the medium size of the <em class="e000I2">Bébés Hurel</em>.</p>

<p>“Princess Paulina, what did you eat for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Six oysters and some breast of chicken.”</p>

<p>“Princess Paulina, do you speak English?”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Princess Paulina, can you speak German?”</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Sehr gut.</em>”</p>

<p>“Princess Paulina, will you give me a kiss?”</p>

<p>“Kiss a gentleman!” cried the little princess, quite
alarmed.</p>

<p>And she consulted her tall brother with a look. The tall
brother gave an affirmative nod of the head, and the princess
submitted to the caress—this is how I am able to inform
those who may not be aware of the fact, that, like new-born
babies, a little dwarf smells like a grey mouse.</p>

<p>But there is no need for sensitive souls to distress themselves
about these fragile beings. Vanity is quite as strong
<span class="xxpn" id="p069">[p069]</span> in a dwarf as in a man, and every “Princess Paulina” in the
world is pleased to be exhibited. Besides, the parents of
these goslings with golden eggs are too much interested in
prolonging their lives ever to maltreat them. Those who
should be pitied are the poor children sold once for all to a
speculator. One of these dwarfs met with a tragic fate some
years ago.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i083.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He was named Joseph. At seventeen he measured only
27 inches, and had a thin, woebegone face rendered grotesque
by an enormous nose which, like his hands and feet, was
abnormally large. <span class="xxpn" id="p070">[p070]</span></p>

<p>His parents, small agriculturists at Saintes, sold him in
1882 to a mountebank, who endeavoured to increase the
popularity of his show by making this scrap of a man become
an animal-tamer.</p>

<p>By dint of great patience six cats were painted to resemble
tigers, with yellow and black stripes. The animals were shut
into a cage with the dwarf, and the unlucky Joseph, half dead
with fear, was forced, with the aid of a riding-whip, to make
the cats perform.</p>

<p>The attempt succeeded for some time, when on July 12th,
1882, at the fair of Beaupré-sur-Saône, one of the cats suddenly
flew at the dwarf’s throat and threw him down by its
weight.</p>

<p>In one second all the other cats had rushed upon
Joseph, and before any one could intervene, the cat-tamer
was strangled, his eyes torn out, his face covered
with blood.</p>

<p>The mountebank fled: a few days later he was arrested at
Lille.</p>

<p>I was lately discussing this tragic accident with M. François,
and my friend, who was drawing on his riding-boots, paused
in the effort to utter these melancholy words:—</p>

<p>“We were certainly happier under the old <em class="e000I2">régime</em>.”</p>

<p>When one is satiated with the abnormal and monstrous,
the thoughts naturally tend towards those entertainments
which exhibit the perfection of human beauty.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that in this respect the public
taste has improved. The infantine and Oriental admiration
which the crowd displayed for enormous women, the
“fat lady” who weighed 250 lbs., is declining so quickly
<span class="xxpn" id="p071">[p071]</span> that the “colossus” has nearly disappeared from the fair.
And really pretty girls are now exhibited in the “Halls
of Mystery.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i085.jpg" width="571" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p072">[p072]</span>
The success of the “Beautiful Fatma,” hastened this revolution.
No fair of any importance is now held without some
imitation of the “Beautiful Fatma” being on the ground.
I noticed the <em class="e000I2">Pavillon Marocain</em> amongst the most successful
of these imitations.</p>

<p>“Walk in, walk in! ladies and gentlemen,” cries the showman
at the top of his voice; “walk in and see the <em class="e000I2">danse du
ventre</em>, as danced at Bardo before the Bey of Tunis! Walk
in, walk in! Hurry up!”</p>

<p>We enter. The booth is clean and prettily decorated; at
one end three women in Oriental dresses are singing a harsh
melody accompanied by the traditional thrumming on the
bamboo drums, which look like butter pots. They are called,
if names are asked for, Aïcha, Dora, and Hardiendja. But
there is a Fatma in the house. She is a negress about twenty
years old, a fine specimen of her race: at its base the nose is
almost as wide as her thick lips, and by this detail Fatma
shocks all our ideas of classic proportions; still, when looking
at this tall, well-made girl, I, for the first time, understood
what travellers mean when they speak of the beauty and
exquisite grace of negro women. In spite of all defects there
is a pleasant harmony in the dark face, brightened by the
modest mischievous eyes. And when Fatma dances before
the negro Bouillabaisse,—first comic actor to the Sultan of
Zanzibar,—her graceful swaying movements, her languid
attitudes and smiling gestures rouse in her audience that
innate sympathy with Oriental views of women, the gentle,
soulless creature of the East, which lies dormant in the heart
of every man.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">

<div class="caption">LA BELLE FATMA.</div>

<p>Another “Hall of Mystery” worth visiting is the “House
<span class="xxpn" id="p073">[p073]</span> of Metamorphosis,” Manager Stenegry, at the sign of the
“Secret des Dieux.”</p>

<p>The real attraction of this establishment is Mdlle. Stenegry
herself, a Romanische of rare beauty, who with her golden
sequins and Egyptian diadem forms the most perfect “Esmeralda”
that you ever dreamed of at sixteen. Inside we
find a second young lady, equally lovely, a charming blonde—Mademoiselle
Lutèce. She fills the <em class="e000I2">rôle</em> of Galatea, “the
marble statue that acquired life beneath the burning kisses
of Pygmalion.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p074">[p074]</span>
“Pygmalion” does not appear, but in a darkened room, by
some device of slanting mirrors, the beautiful head of Mdlle.
Lutèce changes into a death’s-head before the eyes of the
spectators. Then from the youthful polished ivory skull a
rose bush suddenly appears. This eminently philosophical
contrast has inspired M. Stenegry, the father, with some
wonderful variations of the original idea. I recommend his
“Programme of visible and mysterious apparitions” to all
collectors of comicalities.</p>

<p>“Everything pales.&#160;.&#160;,” he says, “everything dissolves,
everything blends. Come and see the <em class="e000I2">chef-d’œuvre</em> produced
by my researches upon metempsychosis; it will submit its
revelations and revolutions to the judgment of the spectators,
who will become its sincere admirers.”</p>

<p>But just now the most æsthetic entertainment in the fair is
the series of <em class="e000I2">tableaux vivants</em> presented to the public by M.
Melchior Bonnefois.</p>

<p>M. Bonnefois is an artist and a literary man. Last year
he published a very pathetic article in the <em class="e000I2">Union Mutuelle</em>,
“Les Drames de la Vie Foraine,” and I have read some very
skilful verses written by him for some of the small reviews
published in the South.</p>

<p>This man has tastefully grouped a limited number of
models, youths and girls, who are not only well trained in
their profession, but also good-looking. Amongst them are
Suzanne Bertini, the model from the studio of J. P. Laurens;
Arabelle, the model from the Bouguereau studio; Jeanne
Laurence, the model from the Baudry studio; Antonio Vega,
from the Academy of Madrid; Rose Linon, one of the
favourite models from the Gervex studio; Berthe Biéville,
<span class="xxpn" id="p075">[p075]</span> Serge Worouzof, from the Academy of Moscow; last and
chief, the star of the troupe, the beautiful Mireille, from the
Academy of Marseilles. This little Phocean is crowned with
beautiful blue-black hair, and has the profile of Pallas Athene,
with all the Olympian coldness, the absence of expression,
and the gravity which distinguished the goddess.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i091.jpg" width="340" height="476" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps, since it is a question of perfection, her arms, like
her bust, are a little thin, but Mireille’s statuesque divinity
reappears in her legs from the hips to the feet. One lady,
whose views upon questions of dress are extremely accurate,
and in whose society I was lucky enough to witness this
<span class="xxpn" id="p076">[p076]</span> artistic exhibition, made an observation upon Mdlle. Mireille’s
attire which I faithfully transmit to this pretty girl and her
directors—directors of conscience and others.</p>

<p>An error on the part of the costumier is the cause of the
apparent want of harmony in the fine proportions of Mdlle.
Mireille’s figure, giving undue importance to the legs. A
scarf has been draped across the hips over the salmon-coloured
fleshings; it is about the width of a bath-towel, and
is so inartistically puffed that its whiteness destroys the
harmony of the outlines, and by its vague resemblance to the
short breeches worn with trunk hose, it transforms a nude
into a travesty. Above the trousers of the page one looks
for the shoulders of the man, and because they are missing,
Mdlle. Mireille looks too thin.</p>

<p>What remedy can be applied to this serious error which
spoils our pleasure? There is some difficulty in the matter,
I know, but it has been frequently overcome with greater
skill: for instance, by the artist who designed a costume for
Madame Théo, as Eve before the Fall, which won the
approval of all admirers of plastic beauty, without shocking
the susceptible. I shall send a photograph of Madame Théo
to M. Bonnefois.</p>

<p>It is a sad proof of our physical decadence that beauty is
no longer found allied with strength; the two qualities,
formerly blended like metals in an alloy, are now entirely
separated, and M. Bonnefois and M. Marseille each presides
over representatives of the two attributes, which, when
united, produced the most perfect types of humanity. At
M. Bonnefois’s establishment beauty is cultivated without
strength, and at M. Marseille’s entertainment, strength is
<span class="xxpn" id="p077">[p077]</span> found without beauty. Yesterday I could not stifle these
painful thoughts when I took my seat on the velvet benches
provided by the celebrated manager of the athletic show, to
watch a wrestling match.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Full of recollections of Plutarch, one remembers that in
the palestrea, Lycurgus made the young girls rub themselves
with oil and contend with the Spartan ephebes; the lines of
Theocritus on the fight between Castor and Pollux are
haunting the lips; the eyes are full of visions of the beautiful
forms of the wrestlers of the tribune—the young men of
Cephissodote, so beautiful that they were taken for the sons
of Niobe, of whom Apollo was jealous. One enters the
canvas booth, the movable temple of the heroic Hercules,
with a religious shiver, and, alas! what do you see? Stout,
<span class="xxpn" id="p078">[p078]</span> heavy men, their hair shining with pomatum, with abnormally
developed chests—this is the glorious phalange;
on the other hand, amateurs without either masks or black
coats, but who are nearly all in the service of the <em class="e000I2">Compagnie
Lasage</em>, men who have served their time, or porters in the
Great Market. No well-bred figures, no delicate limbs.
Compare these bloated Vitellii to the gods? There, my
good fellows, go home to your lock-picking and your
work.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i094.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Yet I remember one tragic anecdote of wrestling. It
happened at the fair at Loges about fifteen years ago. We
had gone into a booth to witness a fight with single-sticks
between a fencing-master’s assistant from St. Germains and
the proprietor of the establishment. The soldier and the
mountebank evidently knew and disliked each other; they
were engaged for some time, and seemed less like holding a
<span class="xxpn" id="p079">[p079]</span> match than settling a quarrel; a good many people had
followed the soldier into the booth.</p>

<p>The mountebank was completely beaten. He foamed at
the mouth, rolling his eyes terribly, whilst the fencing-master,
swinging himself to and fro, made his cane whistle above
his head.</p>

<p>When the applause ended, the wrestler demanded:</p>

<p>“My revenge! take a belt!”</p>

<p>A woman intervened—a tall dark girl, a gipsy, who had
juggled before us with weights and knives.</p>

<p>“Do not fight,” she cried to the soldier in a voice full of
pain. “He is furious! he will hurt you!”</p>

<p>The mountebank sneered:</p>

<p>“Madame fears that I might break you! Are you
a man?”</p>

<p>The soldier turned white. He was a tall lissom man, but
he did not look strong. However, he quietly unbuttoned
the waistcoat that he had put on, and picked up the belt.</p>

<p>The other waited, his arms crossed, a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>They grasped each other, but the struggle did not last
long. The soldier was immediately thrown underneath the
other; the mountebank put one knee on his neck, seized his
head with both hands, and turned it completely round. We
heard a crack. The soldier uttered a horrible cry—the
wrestler had broken his neck like a rabbit’s back. I did not
want to see any more and rushed out, whilst the crowd threw
itself upon the mountebank. But in the evening an accidental
turn in my walk brought me in front of the
booth.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the gaiety, of songs, of meals in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p080">[p080]</span> open air, of the illuminations and noise of the shows, the
wrestler’s booth, silent and closed, was the only dark spot in
the fair. An indistinct form cowered on the wooden steps.
I went a little nearer to it. It was the gipsy, the juggler
with weights. She was sobbing bitterly, her head buried in
her apron—weeping for the prisoner or for the dead.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter IV. The Theatre Booth." id="chapter-4">CHAPTER IV.
<span class="smaller">THE THEATRE BOOTH.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">Although an open secret is now called Punch’s
secret, it is certain that the marionettes’ theatre and
the puppet dance are great mysteries in their way.</p>

<p>Very few people have ever penetrated behind the scenes
of these theatres. They are far better defended than the
Opera, and I am not a little proud of having been admitted
one day at the Versailles Fair behind the curtain of the
Bermont Theatre during the performance of a grand drama,
in one act, <em class="e000I2">The Spanish Brigands</em>.</p>

<p>I had been attracted by a very brilliant oration from Punch,
detailing all the amusements to be found within.
<span class="xxpn" id="p082">[p082]</span></p>

<p>“This, ladies and gentlemen,” he spluttered between his
teeth in the usual way, “this is the real society and family
entertainment. Everything is calculated, everything is arranged,
to please the eye: a review of the greatest Parisian
artists, dances in character, Icarian games held in honour
both by the Greeks and Romans, a Spanish bolero, Harlequin’s
celebrated feats on a bicycle, and, lastly, the great
unpublished drama, now performed for the first time in this
town, <em class="e000I2">The Brigands</em>.”</p>

<p>We crowded in, about one hundred urchins, grandmothers,
and nurses, eyes wide open in pleasant anticipation.</p>

<p>A small Italian musician, his teeth gleaming like ivory from
contact with hard crusts, formed the whole orchestra. He
played the accordion on the front bench. His melody ended,
some one rapped three times, the performance commenced.</p>

<p>First, two Polish warriors entered and performed a military
dance, marking the time with their heels. Then followed a
couple of Spanish dancers, who executed some wonderful
pirouettes and pigeons’ flights. Then appeared the india-rubber
man, who stretched and stretched himself, and finally
bent himself until his nose touched his heels, and then he
sneezed, a performance which convulsed the spectators with
delight. He was succeeded by a lawyer in a black dress,
who doubled himself, became triple and quadruple—a naïve
symbol of the craftiness of his profession—then played in
each of the four corners of the stage with his duplicates and
suddenly flew through the frieze.</p>

<p>The curtain falls.</p>

<p>From every bench a sorrowful cry is heard, “Is it
over?” <span class="xxpn" id="p083">[p083]</span></p>

<p>No. The second part is going to begin.</p>

<p>Rap! rap! rap!</p>

<p>The curtain rises upon a second curtain, which represents
a forest, a chief, two brigands, three acolytes. This is the
band.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />

<p><em class="e00S02">The Captain.</em>—“My friends, I have heard from the old
postillion that a post-chaise will pass through this narrow
road. You must stop it.”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Captain.</em>—“You, Pedro, must guard this defile. We,
my friends, must away to the mountains.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p084">[p084]</span></p>

<p>(<em class="e000I2">The band disappears on the side to the court. Pedro

<p><em class="e00S02">Pedro.</em>—“Halt there; your money or your life!”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Monk.</em>—“But, my brother, I am as poor as you are.

<p><em class="e00S02">Pedro.</em>—“What are those twenty-five golden louis I see
in this purse? And the repeater that I see; I—”</p>

<p>(<em class="e000I2">Pedro attempts to rob the monk. The Capuchin falls on his
knees.</em>)</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Monk.</em>—“Mercy! If I go home without this money
the superior will shut me up in a dungeon.”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">Pedro.</em>—“That’s not my business!”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Monk.</em>—“At least fire into the folds of my frock
without wounding me, so that I can prove that I was
attacked.”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">Pedro.</em>—Very well. (<em class="e000I2">He fires.</em>)</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Monk</em>, <em class="e000I2">springing upon Pedro, and stabbing him with
a dagger</em>.—“Fool! You missed me, but I shall not miss
you!”</p>

<p>(<em class="e000I2">He disappears on the court side; the captain and his band
re-enter from the garden side.</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">They pause before the body of Pedro.</em>)</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">A Brigand.</em>—“The coward, he is asleep!”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">The Captain.</em>—“No, he is bathed in blood. The monk
has killed him. Let us pillage the monastery.”</p>

<p>The curtain falls; the show is really over this time.</p>

<p>I went behind the scenes to ask the <em class="e000I2">impresario</em> Bermont
for the name of the author of this fine historical drama.</p>

<p>“I wrote it myself,” he modestly replied. “I have a book
<span class="xxpn" id="p085">[p085]</span> of plays. I write them in
the evenings, when they
occur to me—recollections,
ideas, anything. We also
play <em class="e000I2">The Passion</em>, <em class="e000I2">The
Temptation of Saint Anthony</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Hell</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Geneviève
de Brabant</em>. The book is
very old, and has never been
printed. We repeat it
through over and over
again. I also perform
<em class="e000I2">Camilla Underground;</em> or,
the <em class="e000I2">Dangerous Forest</em>. But
once in that piece the
‘author’s rights’ found a
pretext for coming in, but
they did not recognize the
piece; I had changed it
all.”</p>

<div class="figleft size4">
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="250" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>His wife stood near him
whilst he spoke, leaning
on his shoulder, tenderly
proud of belonging to a
man gifted with so much
imagination.</p>

<p>If you should ever have
an opportunity of examining
the large volumes in
which the Brothers Parfaict, the Des Beulmiers, de
<span class="xxpn" id="p086">[p086]</span> Monnet, and some other authors have scientifically discussed
the origin of fair theatres, you will find that they
have been always forced to contend against that hereditary
enemy which the <em class="e000I2">impresario</em> Bermont now calls the
“author’s rights,” and which has borne different names in
different ages.</p>

<p>At the epoch when the fair theatres first attracted notice,
that is to say about 1595, it might have been justly styled
the “comedians’ rights.” The brotherhood of the Passion
and the actors of the Hôtel de Bourgogne would not allow
any extension of theatrical performances by their side, and
as they held the power they easily obtained a rule
which restricted the comedies in a fair to wooden actors,
marionettes of Brioché, learned animals, acrobats, and
juggling tricks.</p>

<p>But the <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> are a tenacious race, and towards 1678,
in spite of the opposition from the comedians, the fair theatres
commenced to mount a few well-seasoned farces with actors
of flesh and blood. The head of the police protested, and
the managers once more pretended to restrict themselves
within the limits of the law, resorting to some ingenious
infraction of the spirit of it, which provoked laughter and
put the comedians in the wrong; for instance, the artifice
used by La Grille, who opened, in the fair of Saint Germaine,
an <em class="e000I2">Opera de Bamboche</em>, in which the sole actor was a huge
marionette, that gesticulated to the melodies of an invisible
musician concealed in the prompter’s box.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i103.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the same time the companies of Allard, Maurice and
Bertrand, Selle, Dominique and Octave, obtained great
success in Paris and the provinces. Conjuring tricks and
<span class="xxpn" id="p088">[p088]</span> feats of agility still formed the chief part of the entertainment,
but to them were added scenes with dialogue, <em class="e000I2">comedies
in song</em>, from which our comic operas have developed.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i104.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">forain</em> stage has retained the triple characteristics—acrobatic,
musical, and charlatan—which appear to have
belonged to it from the earliest days of its existence; but
since the century in its refinement values distinction of style,
the <em class="e000I2">grande banque</em> has adapted itself to its requirements.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of theatre booths:</p>

<p>Singing theatres.</p>

<p>Theatres with good variety performances.</p>

<p>Theatres with conjuring entertainments.</p>

<p>The theatres with operetta are the least amusing. No
original work has been produced in them for a long time,
not even any new songs. At the present moment the <em class="e000I2">café</em>
concerts provide the majority of the tedious repetitions
which make the tour of France. The <em class="e000I2">forain</em> opera lives
by spurious imitations and clumsy changes of title. All its
skill is expended in successfully defying the aforesaid
“author’s rights.” It succeeds to its own satisfaction when
it advertises the</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">

<p class="continue">with a large G. Its inventive power is limited to the
substitution of this one letter. And the individuals who
appear upon the stages of the booths to sing the “trial
d’operette” are also the refuse of the <em class="e000I2">café</em> concerts. They
can only impose upon an unsophisticated audience. For
this reason the <em class="e000I2">forain</em> opera is no longer found in the
suburban fairs of Paris or other large cities. It is confined
to country fairs and provincial festivities.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i108.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But the variety houses are on quite a different scale. The
most flourishing and the best known at the present time are
the establishments kept by Marquette and Emile Cocherie,
who styles himself on his programmes, “Head of the <em class="e000I2">fêtes</em>
of Paris.” At the commencement of each campaign, that is
to say before the Fair du Trône, Emile Cocherie gives an
audience in his villa at the Porte de Montrouge to all the
<span class="xxpn" id="p090">[p090]</span> artists who aspire to enter his troupe. In his presence the
candidates must all <em class="e000I2">jouent le canevas</em>, <em class="e000I2">i.e.</em> improvise a scene
with dialogue upon a given subject. The same old themes
are used which have served ever since the origin of the open-air
<span class="xxpn" id="p091">[p091]</span> stage; all the situations of the Italian comedies and Gallic
farces which amused the crowd even in the time of the
<em class="e000I2">escholiers</em>. A new topic is not prohibited, but there are very
few “patterers” who can <em class="e000I2">speak outside as well as inside</em>, as
the terms of the engagements run.</p>

<p>Still clever actors who can improve the performance
receive extra salaries. The illustrious Clam, who is called
<em class="e000I2">the last of the merry-andrews</em>, earned as much as five hundred
francs a month at the <em class="e000I2">forain</em> theatres. I asked M. Cocherie,
who was left inconsolable by the departure of this whimsical
performer, why he did not try to replace him by some young
student of comedy who had passed creditably through the
Conservatoire.</p>

<p>“He would not suit me,” replied the experienced manager.
“I have tried them, and still have one in my show, but he
does not succeed. The lads have not effective voices, they
are not merry and, above all, they have no gift for improvisation.
A commercial traveller who can push a sale well,
a hawker from the street, would be much more in my line
than M. Coquelin <em class="e000I2">aîné</em>.”</p>

<p>And it is quite true, this Clam is a splendid clown. I
do not recommend you to make his acquaintance in the
<em class="e000I2">Clamiana</em>, a collection of jokes which seem very dull when
they are read, printed with old type in a small newspaper.
Clam should be heard outside the show in the tumult of
smacks and kicks which accompanies his improvised dialogue
with his butt.</p>

<p>I begged this important personage to give me a few notes
on his life, and I now publish them as they were given to
me. The last of the red-tails belongs to literary history.

</div>

<p>“At noon, on the 5th June, 1837, a baby uttered its first
cry. The son of the actor Chanet entered the world in the
native place of Casimir Delavigne! Brought up in more
than poverty and naturally delicate, my childhood was passed
in an asylum at Havre, about the time of the great
cholera epidemic, which spared my life; later on, I sold
<span class="xxpn" id="p093">[p093]</span> checks at the theatre door, and considered myself lucky if
I occasionally managed to see one act.</p>

<p>“My only recreation was reading plays and acting them
in a footwarmer by means of little dolls. I was the most
ignorant of the Brothers’ class. In spite of all I became
errand boy and lithographer.</p>

<p>“In 1853 I made my <em class="e000I2">début</em> as a comic singer in the
Théâtre des Familles, established in an old prison.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i111.jpg" width="250" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Some time afterwards I tired of shining in the carnaval
<em class="e000I2">fêtes</em> of the period and returned to Havre as a chorus-singer,
under the direction of M. Defossez.</p>

<p>“I sang in choruses and made floats. Some years later I
returned to the same theatre and gave some performances.</p>

<p>“But in spite of this success Paris has seen me almost
barefooted, ill, and homeless; my food gathered from the
scraps found under the umbrellas round the Fontaine des
Innocents. My mother was poor and could not help me,
and for my own part I would not tell her of my distress,
wishing to spare her tears. By dint of struggles and of
<span class="xxpn" id="p094">[p094]</span> work I distinguished myself as an actor at Nancy, Limoges,
Bordeaux, Toulouse, Havre, Rouen, Besançon, Geneva,
Nantes, Paris, &#38;c.</p>

<p>“I have acted with Henry Monnier, my master, Scrivaneck,
Vieuxtemps, Hoffman, Darcier, and Renard. Circumstances
have forced me to give performances in every
description of city and small town. I have played in stables
and theatres, in barns, and in the Rothschilds’ drawing-rooms;
I have travelled on foot, by railway, and in carts.
I journeyed through one part of France with some acrobats,
with whom I saw it through many colours and on the road
I collected some instructive and still unpublished notes, of
which I am the sole owner.</p>

<p>“My travelling diaries are all my fortune. Afterwards
I went to the <em class="e000I2">café</em> concert with the remnant of my voice,
and was successively engaged in various large cities. I
know some parts of Holland and Germany, a little of
Switzerland and Prussia, a great deal of Belgium, and
something of Italy and Spain. But I know Bohemia best
of all.</p>

<p>“Like the late Bilboquet, I have tampered with every
<em class="e000I2">banque</em> except the Banque de France, but this does not
prevent me from living a quiet, unobtrusive life; my only
wish is that no one should annoy me (this is very difficult
to get), to live a long time and to die without pain.</p>

<p>“I add for the edification of the reader that my sons bear
my name, an item which my father forgot to bestow upon me
(he was so heedless).”</p>

<p>Clam, who—as you may judge from this narrative—has
some claim to be noticed in any complete anthology of
<span class="xxpn" id="p095">[p095]</span> French writers in prose, has “teased the muse” at times.
But his poems echo the prevailing note of his century—they
are cynical and melancholy. You may judge by these
three verses on the death of a comrade in the show. Clam
dedicated them to me:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>“Elle est morte, la cabotine,</p>
<p>Sans avoir essuyé son blanc,</p>
<p>A la bouche une cavatine,</p>
<p>Son bouquet de fleurs sur le flanc.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Dans sa “caravane,” on la garde</p>
<p>Entre un cierge et des litres bus;</p>
<p>Sa mère l’habille et la farde</p>
<p>Comme elle a fait pour ses débuts.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Elle attend qu’on lève la trappe</p>
<p>Et qu’on frappe au rideau trois coups,</p>
<p>Elle attend&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;Hélas! on les frappe,</p>
<p>Mais c’est sur des têtes de clous.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>A man who has so many strings to his bow is not anxious
about the future. One day when I hinted before Clam that
old age might surprise him, without any provision for it, he
replied:</p>

<p>“When I am no good for anything else my friends will
<span class="xxpn" id="p096">[p096]</span> make a politician of me. But I have still some chest left,
and I shall put off the death of the show for many years
yet.”</p>

<p>The improvements, the tricks of every kind which
have destroyed the “outside shows,” have enriched the
entertainments given inside the booths, and have most
successfully transformed the conjuring performances like
those found in the establishments of Adrian Delille and
Pietro Gallici.</p>

<p>Since Delille bought the theatre and tricks of Laroche he
is the king of showmen conjurers. He is third representative
of the name. The first Adrian, the grandfather, was
conjurer to King Charles X., and, since that remote date, at
every fair held in Paris or any large town, a magician bearing
the name of Delille has been seen making omelettes in hats,
juggling with balls, &#38;c., without the aid of pointed hat, long
sleeves, wand, or cabalistic words—a modern sorcerer in
evening dress and lavender kid gloves. The Delilles first
introduced the trick of the <em class="e000I2">Speaking Head</em> into France.
They bought the patent for 4,000 francs, never hesitated to
bring a lawsuit against any one who infringed it, and always
won their case.</p>

<p>The science of white magic has made great progress
since that date. There are always some means of improving
an old trick, and every year Adrian Delille spends
his six months of enforced rest in preparing for the summer
season.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i115.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Like all his comrades, he disbands his troupe in the month
of November, and takes up his winter quarters in Paris,
where he has a study devoted to experiments. He must
<span class="xxpn" id="p097">[p097]</span> be ready to renew the campaign at Easter, to astonish the
Parisians at the Fair du Trône. In his youth the conjurer
worked almost alone, and for hours he would keep the public
breathless with interest and wonder. For this he required
great facility of speech, a mind always on the alert, and the
<span class="xxpn" id="p098">[p098]</span> skill to draw the eyes of the spectators in any direction he
wished away from his secret manipulations. Conjuring
implies a constant struggle against the malicious curiosity
of the audience. “I am not strong enough now,” Delille
observed to me, “to bear the strain during a succession of
tricks; I was obliged to divide the performance. Besides,
now, the public like that best.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i116.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The troupe consists of forty persons. It is a little difficult
to realize the size of the establishment required to work these
large show-theatres. A booth like that of Adrian Delille
can seat 1,200 people, and it is always crowded for the
Sunday performances. They cost an average of 400 francs
<span class="xxpn" id="p100">[p100]</span> per diem, for the principal performers receive high salaries.
Clowns, acrobats, buffoons, and equilibrists, all these artists—and
they are the same who appear in the hippodrome and
circuses—are engaged through the agencies. The engagements
are concluded for one month, but they can be
cancelled at the end of a week at the wish of the
proprietor.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i117.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A good clown, a skilful gymnast, can earn in a <em class="e000I2">forain</em>
theatre like that of Delille as much as at the circus—about
2,000 francs per month.</p>

<p>The dancers employed to pose in the <em class="e000I2">tableaux vivants</em> are
paid according to their beauty and skill—180, 240, or even
500 francs per month.</p>

<p>Delille paid a still higher sum to the two pretty girls who
lately posed for him as the two little combatants in Emile
Bayard’s picture <em class="e000I2">An Affair of Honour</em>.</p>

<p>It would be quite as indiscreet to ask a conjurer to explain
his tricks, as a pretty woman to tell you what scent she uses
for her toilet, and therefore I have never discussed the
subject. The exclusive ownership of a conjuring trick is
difficult to defend in law, and for this reason prestidigitators
are always on their guard against the indiscretion
of their workpeople. They have been betrayed a hundred
times for a bottle of wine and a few banknotes, and now,
taught by misfortune, they surround their experiments with
as much mystery as the old Egyptian priests used in their
worship of the veiled Isis. After all, our pleasure lies in
this mystery only. “These phantasmagorias,” it has been
well said by one of our contemporaries, whom a taste
for philosophic acrobatics has led to esteem acrobats in
<span class="xxpn" id="p101">[p101]</span> fleshings,—“these phantasmagorias please us like every
other phenomena which seems to contradict the universal
order of things, to counteract the laws of nature. The
universe being what it is, we have no other consolation
than the dream that it is otherwise, and this is the true
essence of poetry. Conjuring is lyrical poetry—fable in
action.”<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="xxpn" id="p102">[p102]</span></div>
</div>

<p>The time has passed when conjurers were forced to ascend
a woodpile and worthy folk clung to the honour of bringing a
faggot to roast them with. Every one knows that there is
nothing supernatural in the illusions they create. Usually the
explanation is one of the most simple things in the world,
but our search for it is nearly always unsuccessful, yet whilst
we persevere in it we cannot be bored, and this is really the
only aim in view.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i120.jpg" width="250" height="312" alt="" />
<div class="caption">M. DE KOLTA.</div>
</div>

<p>There is one conjurer more modern than Delille, more
ingenious than Robert Houdin, who has carried the art of
white magic to a state of perfection unknown before. This
is M. de Kolta.</p>

<p>This extraordinary man takes a sheet of paper, rolls
it up like a cornucopia, and from this horn of plenty
he immediately pours an avalanche of roses into a crystal
cup. <span class="xxpn" id="p103">[p103]</span></p>

<p>The spectator is bewildered.</p>

<div class="figcenter size5">
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="190" height="570" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Where do these roses come from?” he asks. Apparently
they had been in some way concealed in the waistcoat
of the thaumaturgist; but how did they get into the
horn? what pushed them? what secret spring made them
flow forth? <span class="xxpn" id="p104">[p104]</span></p>

<p>We must own that no one knows.</p>

<p>M. de Kolta then removes his coat and takes a cage
containing a live bird into his hands. One, two, three!</p>

<p>The cage and the bird are gone; nothing is left! The
clever ones will gravely tell you that the cage was jointed; by
pressing some secret spring it unjoints, closes or elongates
itself. Most probably it assumes the shape of a narrow
cylinder, in the midst of which the bird is imprisoned but
not hurt.</p>

<p>That is all very well, but what becomes of the
cylinder? The magician has no accomplice; he performs
the trick alone, before the eyes of the public. It seems
impossible that any movement could escape that watchful
gaze.</p>

<p>Lastly, M. de Kolta is not satisfied with making a bird
disappear, he causes a woman to vanish—his wife, so they
say; and although he chose one so frail, so tiny, so nearly
related to the elves, that she looks as though she might run
across a meadow without bending a blade of grass, still she
is a woman of flesh and blood, who could not be forced into
the sheath of a sword.</p>

<p>M. de Kolta, who is cleverer than you are, spreads a
newspaper upon the floor and places a chair on the paper.
Madame de Kolta seats herself upon the chair, and her
husband covers the little parcel of lace with a red and black
veil; then rapidly takes the veil off again.</p>

<p>The woman has gone!</p>

<p>Evidently the woman disappeared through a trap; but yet,
whilst she went through it, the veil never moved, and the
newspaper is still intact, though it is much larger than the
<span class="xxpn" id="p105">[p105]</span> edges of the veil. We feel humiliated at being the victims
of such an illusion, although we were forewarned. And we
ask ourselves with some alarm, what is, then, the value of
the feeble organs of knowledge we call our senses, in which
we so blindly place our trust?</p>

<p>But through this uneasiness, this distrust of our judgment,
which conjuring leaves, this entertainment becomes an excellent
school of wisdom. You may believe M. Jules Lemaître
on this point, for he first discovered the philosophical side of
these performances. “M. de Kolta,” he said, “should be
a happy man. He is a true sorcerer. He forces us to see
with our eyes things which we cannot see, and not to see
things which we do see, and this is solely through the
marvellous skill of his agile fingers. In his place, I would
go to the mysterious and credulous East, where I would
found a new religion based upon miracles. M. Renan would
provide a dogma suited to the requirements of those far-distant
souls, and M. de Kolta would work the miracles.
He would be a prophet during his life, a saint, perhaps a
god, after his death.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;But one sorrowful reflection
tempers the pleasure which this idea gives me. The miracles
worked by M. de Kolta are practically injurious. Since we
do not believe in the false miracles he performs—since
nothing distinguishes them from real ones, and we have only
the magician’s word to assure us they are false, what, then,
should we do if real miracles were worked in our presence?
We should say, We know all about them; it’s only conjuring!
And thus the small remnant of faith which we
may still retain in the supernatural is insidiously destroyed.
<span class="xxpn" id="p106">[p106]</span> When the prophet Elijah returns to earth at the end of
time he will meet other De Koltas here; he will himself
be sent to the Eden or to the Folies Bergères. And that
is how the last men will lose their souls—just like the first,
however.”</p>

<h2 title="Chapter V. The Trainers." id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V.
<span class="smaller">THE TRAINERS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">It is difficult to see how man
would have fared if he had
not compelled the animals to serve
him. The science of animal-training
must therefore date back to the earliest stages of the
world’s history; and we may believe that <em class="e000I2">artistic
training</em> is almost as old. The dwellers in caves had
not yet invented the game of fox and geese, and they must
have found some difficulty in amusing themselves in the long
winter evenings; they therefore probably taught their dumb
companions the art of leaping and showing off.</p>

<p>Now that animal-training has become a lucrative profession,
competition has forced the trainers to rival each other, and
their skill has obtained wonderful results. All the inmates
of Noah’s Ark have passed under the whip, from minute
insects to Jumbo himself. Men have tamed serpents, birds,
cats, dogs, goats, monkeys, seals, and pigs. In their desire
to grasp and conquer increasing difficulties, they have even
<span class="xxpn" id="p108">[p108]</span> taken the fleas from the animals they were training, have
bridled the fleas themselves, and taught them to draw a
carriage. Do you remember Virgil’s lines upon a stallion
for the first time subject to the yoke? The poet dwells with
rapture upon the vigorous bounds which wrench the plough
from the furrows. What would he have said of the spring
of a flea, which, at liberty, jumps one hundred and forty
times its own height?</p>

<p>If you wish to know all the mysteries of animal-training,
an art based upon definite rules which vary very little in
their application to the instincts of the different pupils, I
recommend you to read a book which will surprise you. It
was written by Professor G. J. Romanes, secretary of the
London Zoological Linnean Society, and has been translated
into French for the “International Scientific Library.” It
is called the <em class="e000I2">Intelligence of Animals</em>. You need only glance
at the first volume, which refers to the intelligence of
molluscs, ants, termites, white ants, spiders, scorpions, and
the lower articulated animals. But you should carefully
study the chapters in the second volume devoted to birds,
the cat, dog, baboons, and elephant. I fancy that if any of
you are partisans of the Cartesian doctrine, and hitherto only
regarded animals as clocks with better regulated machinery
than our own, you will leave off reading considerably shaken
in your assurance.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">saltimbanque</em>, who is not a creator of systems <em class="e000I2">à priori</em>,
but whose philosophy is purely experimental, has, for a long
time, observed the regularity with which animals follow the
same habits. Upon this observation he has based his method
of training them. <span class="xxpn" id="p109">[p109]</span></p>

<p>Whatever the animal may be which he wishes to train, he
commences by watching it closely, endeavouring to discover
not only the usual habits of the race, but the personal
disposition of the individual in question. One specimen
raises itself naturally upon its hind legs, another is born with
a talent for jumping.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;And this axiom prevails in every
case under training: “Animals are never forced to execute,
at the command and will of others, any movements which are
not natural to them in a free state.” Monkeys love to swing
in the tropical creepers: they are placed on a <em class="e000I2">trapèze</em>; a goat
seeks for pointed rocks—he is a natural equilibrist: so he is
taught to balance himself on the neck of a bottle; a dog
instinctively rises on his hind legs to seize a morsel of sugar
held out to him. He must learn to maintain himself in the
same position.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p110">[p110]</span></p>

<p>Guided by these remarks, a trainer enters upon his task.
He will attain his end if he judiciously uses the triple forces
of <em class="e000I2">fear</em>, <em class="e000I2">greediness</em>, and <em class="e000I2">habit</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i128.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first time that you make a dog stand on its hind legs
you have to contend with the indolence which makes the
animal wish to revert to its usual position. Practise the
<span class="xxpn" id="p111">[p111]</span> lesson every day, and each time reward the pupil with a
lump of sugar. An association of ideas will be soon formed
in the dog’s mind: the disagreeable sensation of <em class="e000I2">walking on
its hind legs</em> will be inseparably linked in its memory with
the pleasure of <em class="e000I2">crunching sugar</em>. And since the frequent
repetition of the same movement lessens the fatigue of
maintaining a vertical position, the dog will at last willingly
perform the feat which it at first disliked. On the other
hand, it must be remembered that the whip is always ready
to punish any obstinacy or awkwardness, and you will readily
understand that a poodle, finding itself in the dilemma of
either walking upon its hind legs and receiving a dainty, or
of not walking and receiving a blow, at once chooses the
polka.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i129.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And here, in its simplicity, lies the whole secret of training
animals. Patience and regularity from the man, habit and
greediness in the animal. There is no other talisman. You
have all seen a pigeon-charmer on foot or on horseback; it is
<span class="xxpn" id="p112">[p112]</span> one of the prettiest performances exhibited. A young woman
is carried round the arena at full gallop by her steed; she raises
herself or crouches down in graceful attitudes which show off
the suppleness of her figure. Behind her, like a mantle
streaming in the wind, the white flight of pigeons follows her
movements. They alight on the arms, neck, and shoulders
of their mistress, who recalls one of the young priestesses
in the groves of Gnide, offering her rosy lips and soft white
throat to the caresses of her doves.</p>

<p>Now would you like to know the secret of her charm?
It is explained in an amusing <em class="e000I2">vaudeville</em> of the old style—<em class="e000I2">Le
Sourd, ou l’Auberge pleine</em>.</p>

<p>“Would you like,” one of the characters in this farce
remarks to his companion, “Would you like me to tell you
an infallible method of catching birds? Well then, listen!
You must strew some corn on your window-sill—the little
birds will come and eat it. Put it there a second time—the
little birds will come again. On the eighth day you need
not put any. The birds will come open mouthed&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and
they will be caught.”</p>

<p>This is the whole secret of the pigeon-charmer. For
seven days she strewed corn in the folds of her mantle.
The eighth day the pigeons were charmed.</p>

<p>This is an almost mechanical movement; the certainty of
success arises from the strength of instinct and the weakness
of intelligence.</p>

<p>With superior animals like the dog, the chances of failure
are much more numerous; but the same individual intelligence
which renders obedience more doubtful, authorizes
the trainer to exact an effort that surpasses intelligence from
<span class="xxpn" id="p113">[p113]</span> those picked performers which he selects from amongst the
pack. And Munito, who played dominoes with his master,
seems to have as much chance of being remembered by
posterity as Archimedes the Syracusian. One of his companions,
an unlucky mongrel, born in a gutter, caused all
Paris to throng to the Folies Bergères last year. Amongst
his compeers he had created the <em class="e000I2">rôle</em> of the clown Auguste.</p>

<p>This clever dog-clown would reach the springing-board at
a gallop, then stop short before the bar, pass under the chairs
when the hoop was held out to him, feign a sound and
sonorous sleep when he was told to perform. But all this
was only shamming, intended to evoke laughter from the
audience. Suddenly the Merry-Andrew would free himself
from his collar, bound upon the board, and cleave the air
<span class="xxpn" id="p114">[p114]</span> with such a wonderful spring that the greyhounds refused to
follow him, and it was necessary to catch him on a mattress
to prevent him from breaking his paws. Some months later
he broke his back in London in a still more dangerous
performance. The best doctors were sent for, but nothing
could be done; he died after a short struggle of sobs and
howls. I met his master some months afterwards, and spoke
to him about his loss. He still wept when he mentioned the
poor clown, whom he had cherished with human friendship.
I listened to all his regrets, and his words reawakened a
sympathetic pang in my own heart.</p>

<p>My lost favourite—a black poodle—was called Miette.
She was not clever, for she never even learnt to stand on
her hind legs, but we loved each other. At that time I
lived on the banks of the Marne, between Nogent and
Joinville-le-Pont, a terribly deserted and solitary district in
winter. If Miette found that I did not return home by the
last train, she would break her chain and go and wait for
me near Reuilly, in the moats of Vincennes. She wished to
escort me through the woods, which, she felt, were by night
full of possible attacks and hidden peril. One day she was
bitten by a mad dog. I did not suspect the nature of the
illness that followed, and endeavoured to open her mouth and
give her some medicine. She looked at me with mad,
supplicating eyes, seeming to say, “Leave me, my master,
I do not want to bite you.” When I knew what was the
matter, I would not leave the task of killing her to a
veterinary surgeon, who might have done it awkwardly
perhaps. I led her into a thicket in that forest of Vincennes
which we had so frequently crossed together on fine, silent,
<span class="xxpn" id="p115">[p115]</span> frosty nights, lighted only by the brilliance of the stars.
My heart ached with the agony of a man about to commit a
crime, who has led his friend into the corner of a wood
<span class="xxpn" id="p116">[p116]</span> intending to perpetrate a cowardly murder. But it was
necessary that she should die. I made her lie down, put
my revolver to her ear, and fired.</p>

<p>Oh, my poor Miette! the long reproachful look you gave
me ere your eyes closed for ever—your loving, childlike eyes!
I dug a hole and gently laid you in the grave. I took off
your collar—it still lies in the drawer of my writing-table,
my hand often touches it when I turn over the confusion of
papers. The little curb rings like halfpence in a purse. And
then I fancy that my poor Miette is moving round me; that
I hear her clumsy gallop on the wooden staircase; that in a
moment she will be scratching at the door.</p>

<p>Is there a better world, a paradise for these faithful
servants of mankind? I dare not assert that I believe so,
and yet, in Dauphiné, I once knew a dog who certainly
cherished the hope of it. He was a small curious-looking
yellow mastiff, a dog of a divine race which the Emperor of
China had given as a choice present to a French diplomat.
He resembled a beast in heraldry, or one of those strange
monsters that we see writhing and baying on painted vases
and reliefs in bronze. Transported into France, the Chinese
had crossed with every breed of dogs for ten leagues round,
and had created a race of fantastic-looking animals which
showed the curious type of the father blended with every
variation of the canine form. Towards the end of his life,
when I made his acquaintance, he had become a dreamer.
He spent whole days with his head resting upon his paws,
his eyes fixed, lost in his recollections. One autumn evening
we went out upon a terrace to enjoy the brilliant night; we
found him immovable upon a flagstone; his head was raised
<span class="xxpn" id="p117">[p117]</span> towards the sky, his eyes, shining like carbuncles, seemed
to pierce the heavens, gazing upon a definite point beyond.
His master was puzzled, and called him three times:</p>

<p>“Kiang! Kiang! Kiang!”</p>

<p>But he remained motionless, like a bronze chimera, soaring
far above us in his ecstasy.</p>

<p>On the morrow he was found dead in his kennel.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i137.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have often thought since that he had some presentiment
of his approaching death, and that he heard the distant
baying of Sirius’s hounds—of those dogs, sons of heaven,
who hunt the Bear, and through all eternity assuage their
divine thirst in the fountains of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Although the grimaces of the monkey may be amusing,
the dog’s capacity for affection has won a higher place in my
esteem. I am wrong; for if a poodle be very near to us by
its heart and its delicacy of feeling, a monkey is more closely
akin to humanity through its gestures and form. Darwin
has written very cleverly on this subject. A baby of four
years old, whom I took to the Corvi Theatre the other day,
<span class="xxpn" id="p118">[p118]</span> and who had not read Darwin, cried out, when the dishonest
cook appeared:</p>

<p>“Look! it’s a little negro!”</p>

<p>You all know the popular performance of <em class="e000I2">The Roman
Orgie</em> by Couture. Behind a table well provided with
biscuits and nuts, a company of baboons, ourang-outangs,
and brown monks is seated. They are dressed like Peruvian
generals, and each has a napkin tucked into his collar. A
poor little monkey, tricked out in a town-crier’s old clothes,
with a white cap and apron, waits upon his comrades,
gambolling round the table. In his right hand he holds a
lighted candle; in the left a basket, which he dances by its
handle. Ah! yes, that head cook! he dances it by the handle
morally and materially.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> You see, he is weighing his provisions
on the sly, and seizing a mouthful whenever M. Corvi
is not looking.</p>

<p>The same entertainment has gone on ever since our
childhood, and since the infancy of your father and grandfather.
And, as it would be difficult to believe that the head
cook is a sexagenarian, we must conclude that a whole
generation of actors have worn the apron and carried the
candle without our remarking any change.</p>

<p>To satisfy myself on this point, I questioned M. Corvi
himself on the subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“My show,” he kindly answered, “is really a permanent
entertainment. As it entirely consists of scenes in which
goats, monkeys, poodles, and ponies are the sole actors, I
keep a reserve staff, behind the scenes, of understudies of
<span class="xxpn" id="p119">[p119]</span> every part. In the pantomime called <em class="e000I2">The Deserter</em>, you
will no longer find one single artist belonging to the original
caste. I have already replaced the judge, the gendarmes, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p120">[p120]</span> prisoner, and the gravediggers, just as consumption or gout
made vacancies in my troupe. The actors pass, the play
remains. No one here is absolutely necessary. If I lost
my first leading gentleman to-morrow—he is a baboon
named Coquelin <em class="e000I2">aîné</em>—the play would not be interrupted
for one single day. We should replace him by his understudy—she
is called Coquelin <em class="e000I2">cadet</em>—and neither the nurses
nor the babies, who are our subscribers for Tuesdays, would
ever discover the change of performer.”</p>

<p>M. Corvi is one of the last representatives of the old-fashioned
trainers, who wore evening dress or a frock-coat,
like M. Loyal, when they exhibited their pupils in the arena.
Modern trainers prefer a clown’s dress, and their intentionally
grotesque appearance is very effective when accompanied by
ridiculous animals like the pig and the donkey.</p>

<p>The terrible Onos, compared by Homer to the divine
Ajax, the ass himself, is now drawn by the ears into the
arena by a clown. Perhaps you already know that the male
ass is a dangerous animal. He may be chosen from a small
race, but his bite will still be formidable, and therefore the
halter, which only seems to decorate his head, is really a
strong muzzle, and his hoofs are never shod. In spite of
these precautions the clown must be very agile to evade the
kicks showered full at his chest, and must be careful not to
miss his spring over the bench when Master Aliboron charges
at him across the arena like a bull rushing at a picador.</p>

<p>The appearance even of the pig has the power of delighting
the crowd, and who can resist laughing when the clown
approaches his pupil and shouts:</p>

<p>“Come here, pig!”
<span class="xxpn" id="p121">[p121]</span></p>

<p>“Eh?” asks M. Loyal.</p>

<p>“I’m not talking to you.”</p>

<p>Although the training of the pig may still seem imperfect,
the education of this animal requires extreme patience from
its teacher. An Irish
proverb quoted to me
by Billy Hayden says:
“Beat your wife with
a cudgel and your pig
with a straw.” And,
truly, the pig’s bristling
skin is so sensitive
that the least
touch of the whip
covers it with blisters,
and disgusts the
animal with all work for ever. Only coaxing and kindness
must be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i141.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The elephant is, perhaps, the only beast yet stricter than
the pig in regard to politeness.
<span class="xxpn" id="p122">[p122]</span></p>

<p>This animal, which the trainer Corradini at the Hippodrome,
and the brothers Lockhart in most places have
exhibited with so much success, possesses all the passions
and all the feelings of man.</p>

<p>I quite agree with you that some of the stories quoted to
us about elephants require confirmation, and I always feel
some distrust in reading the anecdote, related by Plutarch
(<em class="e000I2">De Solert. Anim.</em> cap. xii.), of an elephant which had been
punished for dancing badly, and was afterwards discovered
practising its steps alone in the moonlight.</p>

<p>But there is scientific evidence of the magnanimity of the
elephant, of its deep sense of duty and self-respect.</p>

<p>Griffiths, whose good faith cannot be doubted, quotes one
very characteristic incident proving this self-respect. At the
siege of Bhurtpore, after the English had been encamped for
some time before the walls of the city, the dry winds set in
and soon evaporated all the water in the reserved ponds;
this led to great competition round the last well which
contained any. One day two drivers were at the edge of
the well with their elephants; one of the beasts, which was
of remarkable size, seeing its companion use a pail to draw
up the water, forcibly wrenched it away. Whilst the two
keepers were joking, the victim, though conscious of the
injury, restrained its resentment. But when the thief bent
over the edge of the well to reach the water, the smaller
elephant made a terrible spring, and throwing itself with
lowered head upon its enemy, sent it rolling into the cistern.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i143.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This pride, when once overcome, is of great assistance to
the trainer, but it sometimes produces a tragedy. When
elephants are tamed, the presence of the monitor elephants
<span class="xxpn" id="p123">[p123]</span> can usually be dispensed with at the end of two months, and
the prisoner is afterwards ridden by its keeper. At the end
of three or four months it is sufficiently docile to work, but
there is some danger in subjecting it to this ordeal too
abruptly, for it frequently happens that an adult and perfectly
<span class="xxpn" id="p124">[p124]</span> healthy elephant will lie down and die after it has worn
harness for the first time. The natives then say that it died
of a <em class="e000I2">broken heart</em>; in any case, the death is not caused
by either illness or wounds. (Sir <em class="e00S02">E. Tennent</em>, <em class="e000I2">loc. cit.</em>
p. 216.)</p>

<p>I have also found, amongst the <em class="e000I2">Memoirs</em> of the actor,
Charles Young, published by his son, the Rev. Julius Young,
an anecdote which well illustrates the sagacity and affectionate
sensibility of these huge pachyderms.</p>

<p>The newspapers had announced the arrival in England of
the largest elephant that had ever been seen. Henry Harris,
the manager of Covent Garden Theatre, at once purchased
Chung—that was the animal’s name—for exhibition in a
pantomime entitled <em class="e000I2">Harlequin</em>, which he had mounted
very expensively. Harris paid 900 guineas for the beast.
Mrs. Henry Johnston was to ride it, and Miss Parker was
to act as columbine. But at the general rehearsal, when
Chung reached a bridge over a cascade which he was expected
to cross, he refused to step upon it, distrusting its solidity,
and not without reason. In vain the angry keeper punished
him by pricking him behind the ear with an iron goad. With
lowered eyes and pendent ears, the enormous animal stood in
a pool of blood, motionless as a wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i145.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The captain of the vessel which had brought Chung over,
came in during the contest between the man and the elephant.
He had become fond of the beast, and often fed it with
dainties. The animal had scarcely recognized its friend
when it approached him with a supplicating air, gently took
his hand in its trunk and placed it in the bleeding wound,
then held the hand up to the captain’s eyes. The gesture
<span class="xxpn" id="p126">[p126]</span> said as clearly as words: “See how they have made me
suffer!”</p>

<p>Poor Chung appeared so unhappy that every one was
touched, even the cruel keeper. To win pardon the man
ran out and bought some apples, which he offered to the
elephant. But Chung disdainfully threw them away. The
captain, who had also fetched some fruit from Covent Garden
Market, came back immediately afterwards and held it out
to Chung. He willingly accepted it, and after eating it,
coiled his trunk gently round his protector’s waist.</p>

<p>Since no one has yet succeeded in exhibiting a learned
whale, the elephant is the largest animal that has been taught
obedience to man. Chung’s adventures would therefore seem
a fitting close to this monograph on training.</p>

<p>Yet I wish to crown this chapter by an account of the
training of an animal of very different size—the cat. And
although this sequence may seem curious to you, it is chosen
for at least two reasons; first, that the appearance of a trained
domestic cat is the latest achievement of the trainer’s art;
and secondly, that I am not sure whether the conquest of
the cat is a triumph of <em class="e000I2">training</em> or of <em class="e000I2">taming</em>. There is, in
fact, as much ground for regarding the cat as a wild beast, as
for considering it a domestic animal.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have believed, on the authority of M. de
Buffon, the systematic detractor of the cat, that it was an
untamable animal. The great naturalist states that “it will
not allow any one to influence its idle, thieving instincts.”</p>

<p>The cat has waited for nearly a century, but at last this
slander can be refuted; its falsehood is clearly proved.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years ago a child was born in a Dutch
<span class="xxpn" id="p127">[p127]</span> village, who, from an early age, showed unusual skill in
taming and training animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i147.jpg" width="250" height="375" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the youth was seventeen—his name is Bonnetty—he
introduced learned rabbits, hares, and guinea pigs, into
the arena, so wonderfully trained that even the Dutch, who
are not, as a rule, easy to move, were much astonished.
However Bonnetty was not going to stop yet. Tempted by
the great difficulty of the feat, he determined to prove that
M. de Buffon was unjust to the cat, and with rare patience
he devoted himself to the education of that animal.</p>

<p>He chose two subjects, both Dutch, like himself, cats from
Hooren—M. Bonnetty had remarked, after much
<span class="xxpn" id="p128">[p128]</span> observation,
that the cats from that district are particularly docile—and
he spent some months in training them; then one by
one he added comrades to them, until he had twenty; the
instinct of imitation assisted the later recruits to learn more
rapidly.</p>

<p>The first exercise consisted in making the cat jump at the
word of command.</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Vooruit!</em>” cries M. Bonnetty, who speaks nothing but
Dutch.</p>

<p>The cat does not <em class="e000I2">vooruit</em> all at once. It pauses undecided;
very often it does not understand. But Bonnetty never loses
patience. With a gentle hand, which resembles velvet in its
touch, he softly caresses the cat’s spine, quite determined not
to be angry, yet equally decided not to yield the point. At
last the cat realizes what is required of it, and jumps.</p>

<p>This first step gained, the after-work of education proceeds
more quickly. The animal gets used to walking on the backs
of chairs and the necks of bottles, or to leaping over flaming
circles. But there is one decisive trial to pass through—that
of appearing before the public.</p>

<p>M. Bonnetty has had some cats, perfectly obedient in
rehearsal, which could not be induced to perform to the sound
of music before a crowd of spectators. They coiled themselves
up in a corner of their little house, returning suddenly
to a wild state.</p>

<p>“I cannot treat them as I would dogs,” M. Bonnetty
observed to me, “by interpreting my wishes through a whip.
All violence is useless with them; I can only count upon
what it pleases them to do; and my cats and I always treat
each other with the utmost courtesy.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p129">[p129]</span></p>

<p>And in a moment of effusion his eyes suddenly filled with
tears, and the cat-tamer related to me the story of an incomparable
cat that he had lost in Brussels last May.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i149.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Ah! monsieur, he was a cat that
I can never replace. He would leap
over fourteen chairs with one bound,
at more than a yard and a half high.</p>

<p>“But you know what
artists are: great children, all
of them. On the very evening
that we reached Brussels, I
went to see my animals an hour
before the performance. I found that Thommech had made
his escape. The poor fellow was high on the tiles rushing
after a Brussels cat that had turned his head. He tried to
leap from one roof to another on the opposite side of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p130">[p130]</span> street. He fell, and when I picked him up from the
pavement he was dying.</p>

<p>“Since then, monsieur,” continued M. Bonnetty, after a
moment’s sorrowful silence, “I have made one great resolution:
I have now only sultanas in my troupe, and the
keepers of the harem.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i150.jpg" width="340" height="476" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Like Bidel, who introduced a sheep into the cage with his
lions, M. Bonnetty has forced his cats to live in harmony with
mice and birds.</p>

<div class="figleft size5">
<img src="images/i151.jpg" width="190" height="759" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A flock of Dutch canaries is perched upon a cord stretched
across the circus; near them some white mice and dappled
grey rats are quietly resting. The tamer then opens the
door of the cats’ palace, and in Indian file all the band of
artists, <em class="e000I2">Thiber</em>, <em class="e000I2">Jano</em>, <em class="e000I2">Moor</em>, <em class="e000I2">Edward</em>, <em class="e000I2">Paris</em>, <em class="e000I2">Brussel</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Boulanger</em>, <em class="e000I2">Djeh</em>, <em class="e000I2">Brutus</em>, and <em class="e000I2">César</em>, march slowly out
<span class="xxpn" id="p131">[p131]</span> striding over the rodents and birds, some of which fly off
and fearlessly return, alighting on the heads of the cats.</p>

<p>The first interviews between a new rat and a new cat are
really amusing. M. Bonnetty delicately holds each of his
pupils by the skin of the neck, and forces them to
look at each other, at first holding them at a respectful
distance, but afterwards gradually drawing
them nearer together, until at last they can touch
each other’s nose.</p>

<p>“This proves,” M. Bonnetty said to me, “that
the worst enemies are always interested in knowing
each other.”</p>

<p>I remember that we parted after this philosophic
reflection.</p>

<p>I went home and found my own cat lying before
the smouldering fire. He was asleep, crouched in
his usual sphinx-like attitude. I approached him
gently and said:</p>

<p>“My friend, hitherto I have misunderstood you.
I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>“The friendship of so many great men who, from
Théophile Gautier to Sylvestre Bonnard, have
venerated you as a god, might have warned me
that I was wrong to distrust you.</p>

<p>“Forgive me. Bonnetty has proved to me that you
are neither indocile nor cruel; henceforth I will live
with you in greater intimacy, on terms of confidential affection.”</p>

<p>And whilst pussy purred loudly in the warmth of the
dying embers, I bent over him and softly murmured, like a
religious invocation, the beautiful sonnet written by Jules
Lemaître, the gentle friend of cats and of myself:
<span class="xxpn" id="p132">[p132]</span></p>

<h2 title="Chapter VI. The Tamers." id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI.
<span class="smaller">THE TAMERS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The tamer’s performance is certainly one of those exhibitions
which give the most valuable evidence of the
superiority of man over animals.</p>

<p>Some morose spirits have put forth the lion’s claims to
royalty in rivalry to the supremacy of Adam. In the
<span class="xxpn" id="p134">[p134]</span> menagerie the two candidates meet each other. The lion
has formidable jaws and claws; the man has only a pair of
boots and a whip. Yet it is the lion that obeys! The great
feline’s spring through a paper hoop settles the disputed
question in favour of humanity. One leaves the theatre with
uplifted head and heart swollen with pride.</p>

<p>And besides this philosophic satisfaction, a visit to a
menagerie is one of the most delightful amusements you can
choose. You enter a dark booth, impregnated with a strong
odour of carrion. At first the eyes can scarcely distinguish
the strange sphinx-like forms extended behind the iron bars
of the cages, crouching in dreamy, sleepy attitudes. Suddenly
the gas-burner is lighted. Two keepers enter, covered with
blood like the headsman’s assistants; they bear a handbarrow
laden with great quarters of horseflesh; a third person
accompanies them carrying a hook.</p>

<p>“The animals are now to be fed,” he cries in a showman’s
voice. “The supper consists of more than 600 lbs. of meat.
Those persons who wish to see the food distributed are
begged to stand a little to the right.”</p>

<p>You follow the hook, the barrow, and the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i155.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Apparently some whisper of rebellion has passed through
the menagerie, but just now resting and sleepy. A howl is
raised, which echoes every note of the desert. The keepers
add to the animals’ excitement by holding out the empty
hook; the lions savagely throw themselves upon it, not
seeing that they are deceived. With the gestures of a cat,
they glide their paws between the bars to seize their prey,
and crush their muzzles and their manes against them. As
they pant with rage, their breath rises in clouds of smoke,
<span class="xxpn" id="p135">[p135]</span> scattering the sawdust of their litter. They roar and dribble
with hunger. At last the meat is within their reach, and they
drag the huge pieces towards their jaws, too large to pass
through the bars at first, there is a moment’s struggle, and
then the great lumps are triumphantly drawn in. When the
booty is held, before rending it, the beasts lie down upon it,
with little spasmodic rattles—the expression of satisfaction
after rage. <span class="xxpn" id="p136">[p136]</span></p>

<p>By the side of the lions the wolf is dancing, uttering
lamentable howls. The tigers prowl to and fro in their
agitation like phantoms with lapiz gleams in their eyes.
The bear waits for his piece of bread in silence. And as
the growls of enjoyment slowly, gradually subside, the
menagerie resumes its usual quiet aspect, and the beasts lie
drowsily on their sawdust beds, lazily licking their jaws with
sighs of repletion.</p>

<p>This is the time selected by the tamers to enter the
dens.</p>

<p>The women go in with bare arms and necks; the men
hesitate between a gentleman’s evening-dress and the red
uniform of the Horse Guards.</p>

<p>As the emotions of the audience must be gradually and
skilfully roused, the performance usually opens by the
exercises with the white bear. An attendant with a hook
slips back the protecting partition. The tamer receives the
creature, whip in hand.</p>

<p>“Come in, Pierrot.” (Every white bear has been called
Pierrot ever since the North Pole was invented.) “Come,
you lazy fellow, jump! Show yourself off! That’s right!
Once more! A bar for Pierrot! Well! I am waiting for
you! Higher, Pierrot, higher!” (<em class="e000I2">The strange creature
sways its serpent-like neck and gives a sudden spring.</em>)
“Very well done! Now, Pierrot, we are going to see if you
are a coward. Ready! Fire!” (<em class="e000I2">The tamer fires a pistol.
The bear moves its head uneasily.</em>) “That will do, my
friend; you can go. Ladies and gentlemen, there is only
one thing which Pierrot cannot endure, that is the smell of
powder.” <span class="xxpn" id="p137">[p137]</span></p>

<p>Now it is the turn of Sarah the hyena, which comes in
with its hobbling step and the suspicious glances of the birds
of darkness. It smells the master’s boots, and takes a piece
of sugar in its teeth. It soon retires into a corner, whilst
Mignonne the panther appears. Mignonne performs with
all the grace of a ballet-dancer. She passes from right to
left, over the back of the tamer; allows him to raise her from
the ground by the ears, and kisses her master’s throat near
the nape of the neck.</p>

<p>But this is all child’s play, trifles to commence with; the
appearance of the lion is the event of the evening that we
are all waiting for.</p>

<p>He enters with all the dignity of the leading performer,
almost openly impatient to show himself. His mate follows
him. The couple must have been worth seeing in their
African solitude in their wild courtship.</p>

<p>Now it is accepted slavery. Rebellion and hope are both
over. The lion looks at his master; he seems to say—“What
do you want me to do? Show my claws? Here they
are then. Feign to be dead? Would to God I were really
so! You lie down upon me as though I were a bed; you
invite Aïda to come and share your rest. Sleep side by side.
When I was free I tore a black-maned lion to pieces for
prowling round our den. And now do as you like, whether
in darkness or in light. Fire your pistol, your barrel of
sparks. I do not dread fire now any more than I feared
a battle before my loins were broken in the snare in which
I was caught for you.”</p>

<p>Since it is absolutely necessary to raise some laughter and
vary this tragic monologue, the lion-tamer calls his usual
<span class="xxpn" id="p138">[p138]</span> buffoon, a poor little Savoyard bear, the delight of nurses
and children.</p>

<p>The proximity of the lion is unendurable to the bear. It
is willing to dance, to say yes or no, to carry arms, but it
shrinks from an interview with the desert king, who has
a fancy for receiving it with a loud roar. But we have
plenty of time to observe its caution and to ascertain its
tastes.</p>

<p>The tamer, already impatient at its delay, calls and
scolds it.</p>

<p>“Come in, then, your highness; come in, my little friend.
You are always the first after all the others. Look a little
more lively then, a little more amiable. You are in society.
We have been looking forward to your visit. Here is your
comrade Sultan, who wishes for nothing better than to play
with you a little.” (<em class="e000I2">Here the tamer takes the bear by the
ear and drags it towards the lion, who paws the ground
with threatening claws.</em>) “Eh, but what is the matter then?
Your highness beginning to tremble? Don’t be frightened,
my good fellow. See how well behaved Sultan is; he is
always smiling.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i159.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I sincerely pity those persons who are not amused by this
comical bear. I, who thoroughly appreciate the delicacy of
its performance, can assert that I have never passed a
menagerie without entering the office. This is why I am
now on such good terms with all the lion-tamers—Bidel,
Pezon, Nouma-Hava, and Co. It is already two or three
years since I made the acquaintance of Pezon. It was at the
wedding of one of his daughters with a young man whose
name I cannot recollect, but who had already received his
<span class="xxpn" id="p139">[p139]</span> baptism of blood in the cages. The marriage-dinner was
held at Saint Mandé, in the Salon des Familles. All the
tamers in the kingdom, male and female, had been invited
to this festival. They had not felt it a duty—and I secretly
regretted the fact—to wear either their trunk-hose or their
riding-boots, but were all in evening dress and lavender
kid gloves. We sat down, thirty to dinner, including myself.
On my right was a very dark man with a moustache like that
of Victor Emmanuel; he has since been eaten in a fair in
the south of France. I can affirm that this lion-tamer, as
well as his comrades, had an excellent appetite, and I should
not have cared to find myself between his teeth.
<span class="xxpn" id="p140">[p140]</span></p>

<p>Neither leg of bear nor <em class="e000I2">chaud-froid</em> of lion was served at
the wedding feast, but the wine flowed abundantly, and, at
dessert, all tongues were liberated.</p>

<p>I had, therefore, an excellent opportunity of proving that
these powerful men are in domestic life the most amiable of
mankind. I never received so many fraternal embraces in
my life as at this wedding, where the guests followed the
example of Homer’s heroes and heroines, whose last
representatives they certainly are.</p>

<p>Judge for yourself:</p>

<p>Besides a bag of gold crowns that glittered brilliantly in
the sunshine, the youthful bride entered the new menagerie—I
beg pardon, the new home—with a dowry of four lions. A
friend of the family had offered her a small panther from
Java as a wedding present.</p>

<p>Her godfather had given her two rattlesnakes, and the
bridegroom’s brother had added to these gifts an adult rabbit
without any hair, a curiosity never met with before.</p>

<p>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;You, who seek for some means of securing eternal
youth in your limbs, should devote a little time to lion-taming,
the foam of their rage must be the real fountain of eternal
youth.</p>

<p>Look at Jean-Baptiste Pezon: he is more than sixty-three
years old, and yet one would say that roots, knotty oak
roots, started from his boots and fastened him to the ground,
enabling him to stand so firmly on his sturdy hips. And not
one single grey hair is to be found in the curious black tresses
which fall to his shoulders, worn in the same fashion as that
of his contemporary Cladel, whom Jean-Baptiste somewhat
resembles. Yet the mask of the lion-tamer is cast in quite
<span class="xxpn" id="p141">[p141]</span> a different mould from that of the literary man. At most
Cladel has the appearance of a shepherd; whilst Pezon looks
like a wolf-driver.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i161.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In fact Jean-Baptiste commenced his life of adventure in
that capacity. Born in Lozère, he worked in the mines
during his childhood, and was there initiated in rude muscular
labour at a very early age: but he cherished the dream of
<span class="xxpn" id="p142">[p142]</span> leading a wandering life. He longed for unlimited space
before his sturdy legs, the heavens for roof over his head.
He therefore quitted his subterranean employment and
became a plough-boy. For some years he was celebrated
through all the country side as a tamer of savage animals;
dangerous cows, horses, and bulls were submissive in his
hands, and he forced the beasts to obey him as much by
his audacity as by his strength. He was also a hunter.
One day he snared a living wolf, and it suddenly occurred
to him to leave his servile employment and travel through
the world with this strange companion. The wolf learnt to
“carry arms,” to walk on its hind legs, and to carry a
wooden bowl round to the audience. When enough money
had been acquired by these collections, Jean-Baptiste obtained
another wolf, then a bear, and a bull, which he
harnessed to his cart; and with this equipage he made—to
quote his own words—“the tour of France and the great
powers.”</p>

<p>A little later the tamer bought his first lion at Bordeaux.
It was an animal with a superb mane, but his hind quarters
had been injured by the trap that caught him. At three
o’clock in the morning Jean-Baptiste appeared on board the
vessel belonging to the captain from whom he had bought
the lion, to take possession of his new acquisition.</p>

<p>“But how will you take it away?” asked the sailor, slipping
his two hundred louis into his pocket. “You have not
brought a cage?”</p>

<p>“I have a collar and a chain,” replied Pezon.</p>

<p>He shackled the beast like a small Savoyard bear, and led
him home with a leash.
<span class="xxpn" id="p143">[p143]</span></p>

<p>Now Pezon owns at least thirty lions—as many adults as
cubs. He has built a good house at Montreuil, and is
thinking of giving his farewell performance.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i163.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The success of M. Bidel, Pezon’s comrade and rival, was
even more rapidly attained. At fifty years old he had
reached the summit of wealth and honour. His visiting
card, now lying before me, recapitulates the series of lucky
events which have placed the tamer in this unique position
much better than I could do:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<div class="fsize2">FRANÇOIS BIDEL,
<span class="smaller">CHEVALIER DE LA VALEUR CIVILE ITALIENNE,</span>
<span class="smaller">PRÉSIDENT DE L’UNION MUTUELLE,</span>
<span class="smaller">DIRECTEUR D’UN GRAND ÉTABLISSEMENT ZOOLOGIQUE.</span></div>
</div>

<p>And in the left corner of the card, where you would put
your address, the single word <em class="e000I2">Propriétaire</em> (house-owner).</p>

<p>Do not smile at this; Bidel has the right to be proud of
his villa at Asnières. To him, after so many years spent in
<span class="xxpn" id="p144">[p144]</span> moving round the world, the word <em class="e000I2">propriétaire</em> signifies the
anchor dropped, the harbour won. It is a genuine certificate
of <em class="e000I2">bourgeoisie</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i164.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Bidel is not only one of the richest <em class="e000I2">bourgeois</em> of Asnières; he
might be called the lord of the manor. Behind his gilded
iron gate, ornamented with lions’ heads, with the porter’s
lodge to the left, the stables to the right, and a fine expanse
of turf, the red and white villa looks like a small castle. The
dining-room is decorated with panels, on which Rosa Bonheur
has painted some lions; but this is the only detail which could
<span class="xxpn" id="p145">[p145]</span> lead any one to suppose—unless previously warned—that he
was visiting the house of a tamer of wild beasts.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i165.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I am sure, good people, that you would picture to yourselves
a Bidel ending his life in a room encumbered with the
spoils of the lion of Nemæa and Indian tigers. But you are
far from the truth. Do you not know that an ironical law
governs all the wishes of man, the wishes of lion-tamers as
well as our own? It is called the law of contrasts. In virtue
of this rule M. François Bidel has furnished his drawing-room
in the purest Louis XV., and the ceiling, panels, and seats
are covered with pastoral designs of shepherds; idylls and
love flourish in all the four corners of the pretty room.</p>

<p>Mdlle. Bidel’s piano is the sole object bearing a different
date.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may have seen this charming young girl with
her mother in the ticket office on the day of some great
performance. She has just enough romanichel blood in her
<span class="xxpn" id="p146">[p146]</span> veins to give a slightly exotic brilliancy to her brunette
beauty. Naturally, this pretty girl is an heiress. Her
education and accomplishments are perfect, and she has
passed her examinations at the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p>“Of course our daughter has no intention of teaching,”
Madame Bidel observed to me casually, “but her success was
a satisfaction for her father.”</p>

<p>All this comfort and luxury have not been won without
some dangerous encounters with the lions. Bidel, like Pezon,
has passed under the mill of their claws, and they can both
show the scars of serious wounds to those sceptics who may
be inclined to deny the risk of their performances.</p>

<p>A number of chimerical stories are current about the lion-tamer’s
secret. Here is one of them: that it is usual to mix
narcotics with the animals’ food, or even to teach them those
bad habits which led the celebrated Charlot to a premature
death.</p>

<p>The truth is that a certain number—a very small percentage—of
the wild beasts in a menagerie are considerably
stupefied. Guy de Maupassant told me that in Rouen a
tamer having lost his keeper, engaged a willing man from
the port, to whom he confided the duty of cleaning the
cages. On the morrow, when he went into the menagerie,
the master paused aghast. His new servant had quietly
entered the cage as though it were a stall, and was giving
the lion some heavy blows with his broom handle to clean
between his paws.</p>

<p>At the Folies Bergère a lioness was at one time exhibited
by Colonel Bone, who was taking her round the world. This
animal was so savage that it was necessary to chain her into
<span class="xxpn" id="p147">[p147]</span> the cage with an iron collar. When the colonel merely
passed near the den she would fling herself against the bars
with such fury that the whole car trembled. But one day
one of the managers of the theatre was inspecting the side
scenes and witnessed the following incident: the colonel’s
servant was installed in the cage, quietly painting a background
of savannah on a canvas stretched over the floor.
The lioness was unchained and watched him as a dog watches
a fisherman, stealthily licking the green paint from time to
time; the result being an attack of colic which nearly sent
her to roar in another world.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i167.jpg" width="340" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I, who now address you, have entered a black-maned lion’s
cage quite recently. Oh! do not exclaim at my heroism. A
great many people have visited this captive king of the
desert; first, Tartarin, then all the Marseillais, then Mademoiselle
Roselia Rousseil, who on a similar occasion dedicated
a poem to Bidel, entitled, <em class="e000I2">La Mort du Lion, ou le Dompteur</em>
<span class="xxpn" id="p148">[p148]</span> <em class="e000I2">par Amour</em> (<em class="e000I2">The Lion’s Death; or, The Tamer by Love</em>),
which commenced with these lines:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>C’est un vaillant dompteur, jamais il ne recule.</p>
<p>Son corps semble pétri par les dieux; l’on croit voir</p>
<p>La grâce d’Apollon dans la force d’Hercule.</p>
<p>Pour moi, j’aime surtout son grand œil doux si noir.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>I did not visit the lion in order to write verses to him. I
merely wished to be introduced to him because I knew that
I should have to mention him to you. It was a scruple of
professional honesty on my part.</p>

<p>Here is a true account of the interview without any
embellishment.</p>

<p>The lion-tamer, with whom I had a short previous
conference, answered for the safety of the attempt.</p>

<p>“You must wait,” he said, “in the entrance to the door
until I call you.”</p>

<p>He then entered the cage in a familiar way, and as the
lion was asleep, he pulled it by the ears. When the beast,
who at first grumbled a little, was sitting up and seemed
composed again, my companion called to me:</p>

<p>“Come in, now!”</p>

<p>I went in cautiously at the back, taking two steps forward,
so that I might still be nearer to the door than to the lion.
I must own that the desert king did not honour me by even
turning his head. He was talking to his tamer. The two
gentlemen left me standing, and I looked rather like a bootmaker
waiting for orders from a nobleman.
<span class="xxpn" id="p149">[p149]</span></p>

<p>Man is a coward. The lion’s contempt gave me courage.
I advanced a step so that I could touch the leg of the
beast.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i169.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Oh!” I said, “how silky it is!”</p>

<p>It was not silky at all, it was abominably harsh.</p>

<p>Since then I have reflected upon the feeling which could
have induced me to utter this falsehood, and the result of
this self-examination is so humiliating that I will confide it
<span class="xxpn" id="p150">[p150]</span> to you as a penance. In fact “how silky it is” was prompted
by an instinct of base flattery—a courtier’s compliment—the
toadyism of a coward who felt himself nearer to the lion
than to the door.</p>

<p>The boldest individuals, who put their heads two or three
times a day into the lion’s mouth, have told me that the best
way to withdraw it from the gulf is, first of all, not to open
the acquaintanceship with this experiment; and, secondly,
to perform it with great nerve.</p>

<p>Nerve, that is the great secret of the lion-tamer, the sole
cause of his authority over his beasts. When he has studied
a subject for some time, endeavouring to master its character—and
amongst the higher animals the character is very
individual, very accentuated—one morning the man quietly
walks into the cage. He must astonish the beast and over-awe
him at once. As to the training, it consists—and
here I quote the words of an expert in such matters—<em class="e000I2">in
commanding the lion to perform the exercises which please
him</em>; that is to say, to make him execute from fear of the
whip those leaps which he would naturally take in his wild
state.</p>

<p>There is one fact which no one would suspect—that it is
easier to train an adult lion taken in a snare than an animal
born in a menagerie. The lion of the booth is in the same
position as sporting dogs which play much with children;
they are soon spoilt for work. Pezon possesses five or
six lions which he has brought up by hand. As a rule
they live with the staff of the menagerie on terms of
perfect familiarity, but this frequently leads to tragic
accidents. <span class="xxpn" id="p151">[p151]</span></p>

<p>Lions, even lions in a fair, will devour a man in fine
style.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i171.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Can I say that the fear of such an accident is ever sufficiently
strong to make me pause on the threshold of a
menagerie? No. I cherish, and, like me, you also cherish,
the hope that some day perhaps we may see a lion-tamer
eaten. This contingency sometimes occurs, in fact more
often than is usually supposed. For instance, without
leaving the Pezon menagerie, it is not a year since the
proprietor narrowly escaped being devoured by his bear
Groom at Chalons-sur-Marne. He would have perished if
his son Adrian Pezon had not thrown himself, sabre in hand,
between the two combatants and killed the bear on the
spot.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>This act of heroism has been celebrated by the poet
Constant Robert in some remarkable Alexandrines, which
deserve to be handed down to posterity:—
<span class="xxpn" id="p152">[p152]</span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>L’assistance appelait au secours, et l’horreur</p>

</div></div>

<p>As to Bidel, every one recollects that in July, 1886, at the
fair de Neuilly, a lion mangled all one side of his neck.</p>

<p>Two of my friends were amongst the spectators of this
duel—the painter, Edouard Detaille, and my dear comrade
Paul Hervieu.</p>

<p>When Detaille reached home, on the same evening, he
made a rapid sketch of the conflict between the man and the
lion whilst the impression was still fresh in his memory. He
has kindly authorized me to reproduce it here. The effect
is of a cat playing with a bird. Bidel’s coat was torn into
fine shreds by the scratching of the claws from the collar to
the waist, showing the flesh underneath. On his side, Paul
Hervieu was good enough to send me the valuable notes
which you are about to read. He addressed them to me in
the form of a letter, which has been published in the <em class="e000I2">Monde
Illustre</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The accident took place on one evening in July, 1886, at the Neuilly
fair. The weather was heavy and stormy, and the lion-tamer had one foot
bandaged for gout.</p></div>

<div class="caption">HYPNOTISM IN A WILD BEASTS’ CAGE.</div>

<p>
<span class="xxpn" id="p153">[p153]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“However, the performance was nearly over, and it seemed as though
everything would soon be safely ended, in spite of the unusually refractory voice
and attitudes of Sultan, a fine dark-maned lion (for the lionesses, although I
believe they are all <em class="e000I2">blonde</em> like Eve, can choose between dark-or light-coloured
manes amongst their large-headed lords).</p>

<p>“Suddenly Bidel fell, having caught himself in his blunt two-pronged iron
spear, and in some way tripped over it. Every one present uttered a brief
cry. Then, a deadly silence fell upon the huge tent—a silence so intense that
the hissing of the gas-lights could be heard.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the man’s face at the moment he lost his balance.
I still see his starting eyes, the white balls vividly contrasting with his features,
congested by gout and by his previous efforts. It was the expression of one
who feels that he is lost, who is sinking into an abyss. Now the tamer was
lying upon the floor of the cage like an inert mass, without a gesture or a cry
for help. He never attempted to raise himself, probably through some tactic
dictated by his experience, but apparently he had the time to do it in, for the
lion still remained crouched a few yards away.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i175.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Perhaps, my dear Le Roux, you have some wish that I should define the
nature of the emotion which seizes an eye-witness under these circumstances?
This emotion is certainly multiform. Thus, for my own part, you may feel
sure that I was distressed, horrified—that I regretted being present on that
fatal evening.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;On the other hand, if you do not object, I will tell you that
I was accompanied by a friend, a kind of inseparable, who is very curious
about rare sensations.</p>

<p>“Now this friend has since confessed to me that whilst the lion remained
immovable he was conscious of one idea&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;how can I express it?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;In
short, it was like a ferocious wish that something unexpected should happen,
like a monstrous impatience.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>“And, in excuse for my friend, I try to convince myself that he was not
alone in feeling an abominable and vague desire; to me it seemed to have
imprinted a fugitive expression upon all the blanched faces that rise before
me even now: for instance, that of a small, freckled, red-haired woman
<span class="xxpn" id="p154">[p154]</span> clinging to her husband’s arm, who gnawed her lower lip and mercilessly
climbed upon my feet—mercilessly, at all events, for my feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“At last the lion raised himself upon his four paws, and without advancing,
gazed at his inert master with extreme distrust of the mass armed with a whip,
‘who was saying nothing worth hearing.’ One second passed in this way, or
one century, I could not be sure which. Then Sultan made, towards what
he began to consider a possible prey, two small furtive steps&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;two cat-like
steps, prudent and stealthy&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and again, two little steps. Then he
laid one of his heavy paws upon his tamer’s shoulder, still not maliciously,
rather as a caution, as we should place one hand upon a sheet of paper in
danger of blowing away.</p>

<p>“In thus interpreting the ideas passing ‘through the darkness a lion has
for soul,’ to quote a line from Victor Hugo, I have at least the satisfaction
of knowing that my impressions harmonize with the picture that Edouard
Detaille seized with the eye of a great painter.</p>

<p>“But oh, my dear Hugues Le Roux, no pencil of the illustrious artist can
depict, all the resources of the pen are powerless to describe, the frightful
tumult which, in the hitherto silent theatre, greeted this first act after the
gloomy prologue—an infernal din, the noise of falling chairs, of shouts, of
screams!&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>“If I ventured to write an essay on the physiology of modern wild beasts
<span class="xxpn" id="p155">[p155]</span> in the course of the reflections which I should be forced to devote to the
accidents of the show, I should not fail to mention these axioms:—</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i177.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“1. A female spectator never faints until there is nothing more to
see&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>“2. The audience in the second places is only waiting for an opportunity
to rush into the first seats&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>“And, in fact, without a moment’s interval, all the barriers were scaled.
Round the cage women were eagerly pushing men aside in their efforts to get
a better view. And shrieks!—but the shrieks!</p>

<p>“When the clamour first arose Sultan turned his head towards the multitude,
<span class="xxpn" id="p156">[p156]</span>
which he looked at with really sublime tranquillity for an amateur, as
my friend pointed out to me. No doubt it was the vivid light and the
movement of the crowd which made the lion wink—yes, his eyes twinkled.
And in itself that gave a shadow of indulgence to his strength. But now he
returned to his captive, tormenting, teasing, mumbling, rather than biting him.
It was like the play of a pupil who emancipates himself, but is yet conscious
of his fault. But then it was lion’s play! Sultan moved in small
jumps, all four paws together, turning his hind quarters to the gallery, tossing
his jaws, full of no one knew what&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;perhaps a human head!</p>

<div class="figcenter size5">
<img src="images/i178.jpg" width="190" height="380" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Here I can guarantee, my dear Le Roux, that those who at first shared
my friend’s infamous and fortunately indefinite wish, must, like him, have
found themselves almost fainting before such a realization of carnage.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;It
was frightful and senseless. One felt scarcely alive, and no longer heard
oneself howl. Suddenly the lion relinquished his prey and steadily watched
the back of the cage, behind which he must have caught the sound of some
noise only perceptible to a feline ear in the tumult of this bloody orgie. In
the midst of the excitement the door was abruptly opened and two men
appeared, presenting like bayonets two simple iron bars.
<span class="xxpn" id="p157">[p157]</span></p>

<p>“When he saw them Sultan timidly drew back like a guilty schoolboy who
has failed in respect towards his master, and who is recalled to his duty by
the entrance of the monitors. He was already in retreat, backing into the
neighbouring cage, spurred on by the vibrations of the partition which the
men were handling.</p>

<p>“Already, too, Bidel had been raised, and his first energetic movement was
to rush towards the lion, who, now separated from his enemy, watched him
through the railing, rather jeeringly moving his head from right to left. A
thunder of ‘Bravos’ and shouts of ‘Enough! enough!’ stopped the lion-tamer,
who had one half of his neck laid open. From his forehead, just
between the eyes, a red strip hung down. The linen showed everywhere
beneath the holes in the cloth. The skin on his knees was bare, yet
intact.</p>

<p>“After this scene, whilst the wounded man received the first dressing to
his wounds in his travelling-van, the general attention was drawn towards
Sultan, who had returned to the society of his comrade Nero, the <em class="e000I2">blonde</em> lion,
who was languidly stretched out, digesting his daily rations of meat and
blows. But the dark-haired lion did not lie down; he restlessly prowled up
and down in suppressed excitement, his haughty nostrils sniffing the scent of
blood in the air. His tail lashed his sides alternately. And each time that
he passed Nero’s jaws, the latter soothingly licked a purple curdled spot,
which the taster of human blood still retained upon one of his great toes.</p>

<p>“At this moment a harsh voice in the crowd murmured close to my ear—</p>

<p>“‘<em class="e000I2">Moâ, j’étais pértisan du lione!</em>’ (‘I was for the lion.’)</p>

<p>“Turning round, I found myself facing an emaciated being, tall as a pole,
beardless, wrinkled, without any visible marks of age, and very dirty. In the
nervous state in which I found myself, a superstitious influence at first led me
to believe that I had met the Englishman who makes it his profession to
follow lion-tamers about the world until there is not a joint of them left.</p>

<p>“But now I believe that the speaker had no connection with the legendary
lord. And the <em class="e000I2">lione</em> of which he was <em class="e000I2">pértisan</em> must have been the most
respectable acquaintance that he could hang on to. I have, in fact, met this
individual again in the bookmakers’ corner of the racecourse at Longchamps,
and this was his trade: imagine a start of six horses; he would go up to six
greenhorns, and successively murmur in their ears, as quickly as possible, the
name of a different winner to each man. After the race he went up to the
individual whom luck had favoured and claimed a reward.</p>

<p>“Let us, then, my dear Hugues Le Roux, distrust all the new acquaintances
we may meet, even under the patronage of a lion, and let us rely upon old
friendships, such as I feel for you.</p>

<p class="right">“<em class="e00S02">Paul Hervieu.</em>”
<span class="xxpn" id="p158">[p158]</span></p></div>

<p>I have quoted, almost as it was written, this letter from
an artist, who, like the lion possesses a good eye and velvet
paws, first, because I felt sure that it would interest you
deeply; secondly, because it delighted me; and thirdly,
because it is a good proof that there was some danger in
approaching the lion, whom I interviewed in his cage for
your satisfaction. I do not wish to pose before you as a
Tarasconese hero, but I do not wish either that you should
take me for the pantaloon of Italian comedy.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter VII. Equestrians." id="chapter-7">CHAPTER VII.
<span class="smaller">EQUESTRIANS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">I retain amongst the recollections of my provincial
childhood, the remembrance of an annual festival, in
itself noisy and marvellous, and even now, when I close my
eyes, I can recall the brightness of its lamps.</p>

<p>Every year, at Saint Michel, in the month when the clear
heaven is spotted with kites, in one square of the old city,
by the side of the paved road by which the Paris coaches
formerly passed with sonorous smacking of the whip, a palace
of new planks would rise in a few days as light as a house
of cards. Enormous placards on every wall announced the
arrival of a grand circus consisting of fifty horses and one
hundred and fifty artists.</p>

<p>For some weeks beforehand our boyish hearts were
seriously disturbed. Every day, after school-hours, with
<span class="xxpn" id="p160">[p160]</span> books under our arms, walking like truant schoolboys, we
went to enjoy, through the half-open doors of the stables,
the intoxicating smell of horses, blended with the scent of
fresh sawdust and that perfume of musk which turns the
brains of men. And then, peeping through the chinks
between the badly fitting planks, we could watch, in the half
light of the circus, the rehearsals of the beautiful equestrians
for whom our youthful hearts were beating, as naïve and
courageous as those of their own horses.</p>

<p>At last some fine morning the passers by would see on the
placards the announcement of a gala performance. “The
professors of the college and MM. the pupils of the Lycée
will honour this entertainment by their presence.”</p>

<p>It was on one of these evenings, now almost twenty years
ago, that I first saw and loved poor Émilie Loisset, before her
success in Paris and Vienna, when she made her <em class="e000I2">début</em> in the
<em class="e000I2">haute école</em>, and played in a pantomime disguised as Prince
Charming, with her sister Clotilde, now an Hungarian
princess. Her touching story has been related by Philippe
Daryl in his charming novel <em class="e000I2">La Petite Lambton</em>. At that
time Émilie was not more than eighteen years old, and she
was the most charming creature in the world. Still her eyes
and her face wore a curiously melancholy expression. I
learnt afterwards that the most flattering success could never
dispel the instinctive distrust of life, the romantic fancy for
gloomy subjects which afterwards led her to take a house
exactly opposite the little cemetery of Maisons-Laffitte.</p>

<p>She was buried in it two days after she had been carried
from the circus mutilated and crushed by the fall of her
horse, which, in refusing a jump, had fallen upon her.
<span class="xxpn" id="p161">[p161]</span></p>

<p>Forgive me for opening this chapter by evoking the
melancholy smile of one who is no more. But I owe this
tribute to Émilie Loisset; for it is through her, that, as a
child, I received the first revelation of the beauty of a
woman on horseback, of the artistic union of the two most
perfect curvilineal forms in creation—the horse adding height
to the woman by the majesty of its stature, the woman
daringly poised on the animal like a wing.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i183.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But long and serious work, both for the equestrian and the
horse, has preceded this harmonious union. Although the
woman and the animal have acquired the habit of conquering
difficulties together, and have even attained perfect unison of
will and obedience, yet they have each studied alone, slowly
<span class="xxpn" id="p162">[p162]</span> reaching that perfection, that confidence in their own powers,
which produce the success of their alliance.</p>

<p>It is important that the various phases of this education
should be defined at once. The studies of the equestrians of
the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>, the highest form of training for horse and
rider, differ completely from those of the pad equestrian,
whilst the lessons given to performing horses differ equally
from those of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>.</p>

<p>France possesses the legendary trainer of performing
horses, M. Loyal. For thirty-five years he has introduced
his pupils to the public. M. Franconi possesses an old mare—<em class="e000I2">la
mère Tulipe</em>—twenty-two years old, who was trained
under his whip. Every year M. Loyal undertakes some new
<span class="xxpn" id="p163">[p163]</span> pupils, and enlarges the sphere of his conquests. He is so
certain of his own pre-eminence that he takes no trouble to
conceal his method. He has often invited me to his rehearsals,
and I have met fellow-workers there who had gone,
like myself, to learn from him. One day M. Loyal even gave
one of us a short essay on the subject of his work, which has
since been published.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i185.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
<span class="xxpn" id="p164">[p164]</span></div>

<p>The horse, in the opinion of the celebrated trainer, is
one of the dullest animals created; it has but one faculty,
memory. On this account it must be forced to learn its
tricks by the aid of the curb and whip; they are imprinted
in its memory by the whip if it resist, and by presents of
carrots if it obey. On these terms every horse can be trained,
but it is well understood that certain breeds, such as Arabian
and German horses from Old Prussia, are easier to teach than
any others, and also that the animal’s age is of great importance.
It must not be either too young or too old; the best
educations are given between five and seven years old. Before
that age the horse is too excitable, too nervous; he gets confused.
Later than that his muscles are not sufficiently flexible.</p>

<p>The A B C of education consists in rendering the horse
familiar with the arena, making it go round regularly and
stop at a given signal. To teach it this first lesson, M. Loyal
leads the creature into the circus and places it close to the
palisade, whilst he goes into the centre of the ring. In his
left hand he holds a long leash, which has been passed through
the curb or <em class="e000I2">cavesson</em>—every one knows that this is a semicircle
of iron armed with a sharp point, which is placed upon
the nose of the horse. In his right hand he holds a long
whip, whilst an assistant, armed with a strong riding-whip, is
concealed behind the animal. In this position the trainer
utters a call, then lightly pulling the horse, forces it to walk.
If it resist the assistant gives it a blow with the whip, if it
obey it receives a carrot from its master as a reward, after
three or four turns round the arena. To make it stop, the
trainer suddenly cracks the whip in his pupil’s face, whilst the
assistant throws himself in front of it.
<span class="xxpn" id="p165">[p165]</span></p>

<p>The same method is used in teaching a horse to leap. It
is placed in front of a barrier, and is encouraged to jump
over it by voice and gesture; if it refuse, the assistant gives
it a volley of blows on the croup with his whip. If it jump,
the ever ready carrot is its reward.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i187.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE MARE TULIPE</div>
</div>

<p>To make it point, the ring-master has simply to place
<span class="xxpn" id="p166">[p166]</span> himself squarely in front of the horse, to shake his riding-whip
with the left hand, whilst he cracks his long whip with
the right.</p>

<p>But although the horse learns these tricks with comparative
facility, a great effort is required before it can be taught to
kneel. The trainer is obliged to resort to surprise. A
bracelet is attached to the two fore pasterns just above the
hoof, and a cord is attached to it by one end, the other being
held by the trainer. Suddenly M. Loyal attracts the attention
of the horse by a sharp cry; at the same time he shakes its
confidence by a pull at the cord and a vigorous blow on its
shoulder. In a short time the horse kneels down at the
master’s call without being tripped or coerced in any way.</p>

<p>Next to this achievement, the most difficult feat is teaching
a horse the trick of <em class="e000I2">changing feet</em>. This requires fully a year
of patience. The animal is led into the arena and commences
its usual exercise round it. The trainer allows it to settle
quietly into its stride, then abruptly, with a touch of the
whip cleverly applied, he tries to break its pace; that is to
say, to make it change step. If this result is obtained, the
horse is allowed to gallop round the ring once or twice, then
it is checked again to make it return to its former step.
When the animal understands what it ought to do at the
touch of the whip, instead of completing the turn round the
ring on one foot, it is forced to change at the half round.
Afterwards it is only allowed a quarter turn, then only three
or four steps without changing, and lastly only two. The
horse thus appears to dance the polka when it performs to
music, which accompanies and follows its movements.</p>

<p>The ring-master usually chooses a well-bred horse from
<span class="xxpn" id="p167">[p167]</span> amongst the animals trained in this way, and already broken,
for initiation into the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i189.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p>No one will expect me to discuss here the principles of
this training, nor even the theories of circus horsemanship.
<span class="xxpn" id="p168">[p168]</span> I refer the reader to the special treatises written upon the
subject by men in the profession, particularly to the fine book
which the historian of sport, Baron de Vaux, has published
under the title of <em class="e000I2">Les Hommes de Cheval</em>.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> I especially
recommend the perusal of the chapter consecrated to the
Franconi family. It contains an account of how Laurence
Franconi taught the present manager of the two circuses the
principles of the School of Versailles, whilst freeing good
horsemanship from the superfluities in use in the time of
Pluvinel. Laurence Franconi wished for a less formal, less
studied style of horsemanship. The introduction into France
of English horses trained in the hunting-field and on the
race-course, and the re-organization of the cavalry, had
demonstrated the necessity of preparing horses for greater
freedom of action. It was realized that good riding did not
consist merely in forcing a horse to show off and tire itself
uselessly in obtaining a striking effect, but in well calculating
the strength of the steed, in husbanding its forces, and
regulating its paces. It was at last recognized that the ideal
horse of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> should be easy in its balance and in
its artificial paces under the guidance of its rider, and that on
his side the rider should only use the force necessary to
maintain this balance, and to secure the execution of the airs
of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>.</p>

<p>On these principles Laurence Franconi trained <em class="e000I2">Blanche</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Norma</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Hector</em>; Victor Franconi, his son, trained
<em class="e000I2">Frisette</em>, <em class="e000I2">Ajax</em>, <em class="e000I2">Waverley</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Brillante</em>; and Charles
Franconi, his grandson, educated <em class="e000I2">Régent</em> and <em class="e000I2">Moscou</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p169">[p169]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i191.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I remember being present at the Cirque d’Été during one
of Moscou’s rehearsals, ridden by Mdlle. Marguerite Dudlay.
The little empty circus was illumined by a red light, the
reflection of the April sun upon the velvet of the benches.
Charles Franconi was watching the work of the equestrian
and her horse. It was a Russian stallion, beautifully shaped
and very elegant; in its veins it showed the vigour of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p170">[p170]</span> Slav-blood, full of revolt, excitement, passion, and violence,
veiled by affected gentleness, lost in compliance with its
rider’s will.</p>

<p>A ring-master, armed with a whip, held the horse in front
of a barrier which he gradually raised. Without any apparent
effort Mdlle. Dudlay lifted the grand quivering beast over
the bar. The young girl was bareheaded, and her hair had
fallen down with the shock. She was a charming picture in
her dangerous leaps, with her long wavy hair flowing over
her shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i192.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the rehearsal I went up to her to speak about her
horses. She was very fond of them, and would not allow
them to be scolded. They were her friends.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i193.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Moscou is so gentlemanly!” she said, showing me the
<span class="xxpn" id="p172">[p172]</span> horse, which an attendant was leading away covered with
foam. “He has such good manners!”</p>

<p>And in a low tone she owned to me that she preferred him
to Regent, a grey of classic beauty, much more reliable than
his comrade—loyal, vigorous, and brave; but he replaced
coaxing by a military deportment, the correct stiffness of an
officer.</p>

<p>“No doubt I am unjust,” said Mdlle. Dudlay, “but how
can I help it? Moscou and I love each other.”</p>

<p>That is the secret of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> as well as of everything
else. Habit and skill are insufficient—love is necessary
too. It is through love of the little hands which caress
their necks that these great horses throw all their energies
into leaps which exhaust them; it is through love that they
humiliate themselves, that they kneel down. For my own
part, I know no grander spectacle, no more spiritual combination,
no triumph more admirable of mental over physical
force.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to add that these instances of
perfect harmony are the exception, not the rule. The little
“mashers” in white ties and dress-coats who encumber the
entrance to the ring, and surround the equestrian as she
mounts her saddle, crying “Bravo!” and “<em class="e000I2">Très chic!</em>” at
every movement she makes, hope by their eagerness, by
these exclamations, to pose as horsey men in the eyes of the
crowd; but they never imagine the duplicity of which they
are the victims nineteen times out of twenty.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i195.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HAUTE ÉCOLE.</div>
</div>

<p>There are, in fact, two very different categories of equestrians
of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>; first the wives, daughters, and
sisters of the circus managers, who are placed on a horse
<span class="xxpn" id="p173">[p173]</span> trained in the establishment at an early age. Let us softly
add that these subjects are nearly always, to quote an expression
of M. Molier, “Les fruits secs du panneau.”<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> It
sometimes occurs also that a well-to-do manager, who thinks
of marrying his daughter in the <em class="e000I2">bourgeoisie</em>—or even in the
aristocracy—hesitates to exhibit the young girl in the semi-nudity
of tights. He is afraid of alarming the future
husband. This has happened with several accomplished
equestrians like the late Émilie Loisset, and, at the present
moment, Mdlle. Renz.</p>

</div>

<p>As a rule, the equestrian of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> is a pretty girl
who wishes to appear in a circus, and who has found some one
<span class="xxpn" id="p174">[p174]</span> to minister to her vanity. This “some one” must be
rich—very rich. The horsewoman in question must take
with her three trained horses—two of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>, and
one leaper. This trio of horses costs a great deal. It is
only in a circus that they can be obtained ready to work
<span class="xxpn" id="p175">[p175]</span> with a woman, and the trade in them is a speciality of
German circuses. Old horses trained in the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>,
regular as clocks in their movements, may be found there
for sale at from 10,000 to 15,000 francs each. The value of
the horse sometimes even rises to 20,000 francs if it has a
good tail.</p>

<p>A few weeks’ work suffice to “adapt”—another expression
of M. Molier, to whom I owe the revelation of all these
secrets—a very mediocre equestrian to one of these mechanical
horses. The animal, annoyed by its bad rider, who
shuffles on her saddle, does not perform one-half of the
work which the man has taught him. But the public does not
know this, and the would-be sportsmen who adorn the
entrance to the ring open admiring eyes when the pretty
girl assures them, from the superior height of her saddle,
that she trained the horse herself.</p>

<p>These frank explanations will probably make many pretty
enemies for me; but, at least, they ought to assure you of
the sincerity of the admiration and respect which I profess
for the <em class="e000I2">pad equestrians</em> or <em class="e000I2">standing equestrians</em>.</p>

<p>Apparently, in a circus, a woman’s virtue is in inverse
proportion to the length of her skirts; the riding-habit is
suspected, whilst muslin petticoats soar above all scandalous
aspersions.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i200.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The “standing” equestrian is usually married to a circus
artiste whilst still very young; she is an excellent housewife
and a model mother. As long as maternity does not interfere
with her profession, she shares her husband’s dangerous
performances during her youth. With him she dislocates
herself, and bravely fractures her arms and legs. She has
<span class="xxpn" id="p176">[p176]</span> scarcely recovered before she recommences her work. Her
circus education is complete. She was placed on a horse at
six years old, and besides her standing-up performances—the
<span class="xxpn" id="p177">[p177]</span> most difficult of all—she has learnt the mimic art, the slack
wire, juggling, gymnastics, sometimes even the “carpet.”
I am not alluding to the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>. An equestrian who
can ride standing is so sure of her balance, and so much
accustomed to her horse, that she can ride on a side
saddle with very little instruction. She can therefore appear
as an equestrian of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> with only a few days’
rehearsal.</p>

<p>But amongst all the necessary studies that form part of
the education of a pad equestrian, there is one fundamental
and primary one to which she devotes as much time as to
the riding-school; this is the art of dancing. The equestrian
follows the same classes as a ballet girl. Dancing lessons
make her turn her feet and knees out, teach her to carry her
arms and head well, and give her equilibrium and grace.
There are some instances of dancers who, having injured
themselves in the exercise of their art, have learnt to ride
standing in less than a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i202.jpg" width="600" height="767" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The horse ridden by a pad equestrian should be a reliable
animal, with smooth even paces. The regularity of its
movements is so important that now the most popular
equestrians possess their own horses, and insist upon the
manager of the circus engaging them too. This is a wise
precaution. I remember one day at the Cirque d’Été seeing
Mdlle. Adèle Rossi contend with a fine piebald horse which
replaced her usual steed. She appeared as a jockey, standing
and booted, in a vaulting performance in which she was
charmingly jaunty and graceful. She made her spring in
the ring, and alighted standing upon the galloping horse.
Each time she leaped the animal was startled and changed
<span class="xxpn" id="p179">[p179]</span>
its foot; this produced an abrupt movement of the shoulder,
which sent Mdlle. Rossi back into the arena. The young
girl was obliged to recommence her performance a dozen
times before she succeeded in it, amidst the applause of the
audience.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i203.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This wonderful equilibrium is only acquired by great
practice and much patience. You may now see an amusing
performance at the Nouveau Cirque styled a “Riding Lesson”
on the programme. The stablemen place a large gibbet,
which moves on its own axis, in the centre of the arena.
From the arm of this apparatus a ring, attached to a cord,
hangs above the ring-master, who is on horseback. The
other end of the cord is attached to the pupil’s waist. You
will at once realize the amusement which is derived from the
awkward movements of the gibbet. The man in the black
coat, who wished to take a riding-lesson, is left swimming in
the air, whilst the horse gallops on the other side of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p180">[p180]</span> arena. But at the rehearsals of an artist, the gibbet
manœuvres with more circumspection, and it has very
generally replaced the cord, which was formerly fastened on
one side to the pupil’s waist-belt and held by the riding-master
at the other end, whilst it passed in the middle
through a ring hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>The first time that an equestrian, supported in this manner,
takes a lesson on the pad, she is made to gallop in a sitting
posture until she is thoroughly accustomed to the movements
of the horse. Then she raises herself upon one knee before
she stands upright, her shoulder turned inside the ring,
between the horse and the master. The equestrian then
gradually rises to her feet, and performs upon the pad all
the steps that she has acquired in the dancing academy.
The man who has followed the same classes with her, now
adds to her work the attitudes and movements of an acrobat;
together they perform the <em class="e000I2">pas de deux</em> and the vaulting acts
which amateurs delight in.</p>

<p>But although these vaulting acts, this springing through
hoops, may charm the public, they are a violent, ungraceful
performance, which can rouse the admiration of the ignorant
only. Ask the real artists, like Jenny O’Brien, what they
think of these acrobatic exercises. They will not hesitate to
tell you that if these leaps are a sure way of winning
applause, they are the worst method of satisfying the
conscience of an artist.</p>

<p>At the same time, if it be true that danger defied adds
some dignity to the effort made, then the warmest expressions
of public sympathy are due to pad equestrians. Perhaps no
one will be surprised to learn that, according to statistics,
<span class="xxpn" id="p181">[p181]</span> circus-riders are more frequently killed than even gymnasts.
The reason is that an accident is not produced by an unfortunate
physical cause only, or by the distraction of one
second: a mistake of the horse may kill the man who is
riding it.</p>

<p>During the years that I have frequented the Parisian
circuses, I was once present at a cruel accident.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i205.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An equestrian, named Prince, was performing at the
Cirque d’Été a vaulting act on two horses, which were
leaping fixed bars. Suddenly one of the animals fell on
its knees, and the man was thrown forward upon his head.
The assistants at once rushed towards him and covered the
body with a mantle. It was carried out, and M. Loyal, in
a choked voice, but with a smile on his lips, came forward
and said:</p>

<p>“It is nothing, ladies and gentlemen—a slight accident.
M. Prince begs that the public will excuse him.”</p>

<p>The truth was that the rider had been killed on the
<span class="xxpn" id="p182">[p182]</span> spot—he
had broken his neck. And whilst a number of clowns
tumbled into the ring, reassuring the public by their jokes,
Prince’s wife and children were weeping over his body in the
great whitewashed room, where the reins of the performing
donkeys were hanging on the walls side by side with clowns’
wigs, training whips, and spangled tights.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter VIII. The Hippodrome." id="chapter-8">CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="smaller">THE HIPPODROME.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The re-opening of the Hippodrome and the first performance
of its pantomime are a great event in each
year; a festival for “society,” which for this occasion makes
a large outlay in spring toilettes, and a festival for the
Parisians of the “fifth floor” and the shop parlour too.</p>

<p>The number of those who cannot escape to the sea or the
country during the heat of the dog-days, of those whom work
and economy hold prisoners, is greater than one usually feigns
to believe. During the whole summer these people have no
other oasis of refreshment within a walk than the great hall
with its movable glass roof, which gives the Hippodrome a
ceiling of stars. It is important to those Parisians who from
July to September will go at least once a week to the Hippodrome,
to know that each time they will see the new pantomime
with renewed pleasure.
<span class="xxpn" id="p184">[p184]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i208.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have frequently overheard the following definition given
by very superficial people:
<span class="xxpn" id="p185">[p185]</span></p>

<p>“The Hippodrome is a circus, of larger size than the
others&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>

<p>There are some degrees of ignorance which should be sent
back to learn&#160;A&#160;B&#160;C&#160;D. On the other hand, some amateurs
may be found who are convinced they are right because they
do not quite know what difference exists between the two.</p>

<p>A circus is a circular arena of <em class="e000I2">fourteen yards nine inches</em>
in diameter, surrounded by benches. Travel with a yard
measure, measure the diameter of the Cirque d’Hiver, of the
Cirque d’Été, and of the Nouveau Cirque. Cross the sea
towards America, follow Barnum and measure across his
arena, continue your journey round the world by exploring
Australia and Asia; lastly, return to Europe by the Caucasus,
raise the canvas of one of the numerous travelling circuses
which erect their tents at Astrakan in the fair time—you will
not discover the difference of a fraction of an inch from the
rule of fourteen yards nine inches in diameter. Fourteen
yards nine inches is the regulation size.</p>

<p>A superstition, perhaps?</p>

<p>Do not believe it.</p>

<p>The unvarying dimensions of the arena respond to a double
necessity: the exigency of the man and the exigency of the
animal.</p>

<p>You already know that the <em class="e000I2">banquiste</em> is instinctively nomad,
both through disposition and interest. It is therefore most
important that, although he continually changes his locality
he should find the scene of his performance unvaried.</p>

<p>This rule is extremely convenient for men, but it is indispensable
for animals. A performing horse must find, in
whatever spot he appears before the public, a ring of fourteen
<span class="xxpn" id="p186">[p186]</span> yards nine inches sanded to a depth of three inches and a
quarter, surrounded by a palisade opening in two places
only, and low enough to enable it to walk round it, with the
fore hoofs on the red cushion and the hind legs in the
arena.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i210.jpg" width="450" height="360" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Hippodrome is not restricted to these dimensions.
Its arena is an elastic parallelogram, rounded at the four
angles to assist the horses in turning. Its shape excludes
all acts of equestrian vaulting, based upon the support given
by the centrifugal force to circus acrobats.</p>

<p>It is not only the name but the principles of art which the
Hippodrome has borrowed from Greece. No doubt the
circus gives us an opportunity of admiring the human body,
after the education of the ancients has restored it to the
forms chosen by them for the eternal life of marble; but
the purest lessons in Greek æsthetics are to be found at
the Hippodrome. <span class="xxpn" id="p187">[p187]</span></p>

<p>You know that one of the most important differences which
distinguish our conception of human beauty from that formed
by Greek art lies in this principle: the subordination of the
body to the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i211.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Christian civilization has taught us that we must seize
<span class="xxpn" id="p188">[p188]</span> every opportunity of mortifying and humiliating the flesh to
secure the predominance of the superior and spiritual principle—the
soul. No doubt the passions and emotions of
this soul manifest themselves by gesture to some extent;
but they are chiefly revealed in the expression of the face,
of the mouth and eyes. Hence the preponderance given to
the head, which, at the first appearance of Christianity, when
the art of the ancients escaped from the Byzantine bonds,
led the early painters to represent hydrocephalic Christs and
angels, with the enormous eyes of batrachians, and emaciated,
anchylosis, meagre bodies. Hence also the habit that we all
have at the present time of judging beauty—and particularly
feminine beauty, which is more expressive than the other—from
the features of the face.</p>

<p>Greece never despised corporeal beauty in this way. She
taught that if the soul be divine, the body is the temple of a
god. And on the same principle that she decorated the
houses of the Olympians, so that it might please them to
dwell therein, she also commanded the body, the habitation
of the soul, to be embellished by gymnastics. She placed
the <em class="e000I2">musikè</em>, the tutor of the soul, and the <em class="e000I2">gumnastikè</em>, the
tutor of the body, on the same level in the practical education
of her heroes.</p>

<p>This is why the artists who embodied her ideal of beauty
did not give more expression to the face than to the torso.
Suppose that the Venus had lost her head instead of an arm;
she would not appear more mutilated. One of the most
beautiful legacies that Greek sculpture has bequeathed to
us is a headless <em class="e000I2">Victory</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i213.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The immense extent of the Hippodrome prevents the
<span class="xxpn" id="p189">[p189]</span> spectator from seeing the details of the features, and transfers
his habitual attention to the observation of the whole figure.
I noticed this effect a short time ago, when watching the
classic poses of a group of young Italian girls—the sisters
Chiesi. To increase their resemblance to statues, and to
produce as far as possible the illusion of nudes in marble,
these young models wear tights whitened with flour. Thus
moulded, the Chiesi mount upon each other, and pause in
bold yet classic attitudes, which combine the poses of the
acrobat and the academy. I did not for one second dream
of looking at the beauty of their faces, not even when they
were triumphantly driven round the ring under my eyes in
the gilded carriage of the late Duke of Brunswick.</p>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p190">[p190]</span></p>

<p>This is an exceptional case. But given equal talent, we
always prefer a woman’s performance to that of a man. It
gives us, besides the peculiar pleasure which acrobatic feats
always produce, the general pleasure which the exhibition of
a perfectly-formed woman never fails to excite. And to us
moderns this is not merely an intellectual and moral enjoyment;
in it there mingles a little voluptuous emotion.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i214.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This fascination, which Greek art knew nothing of, does
not affect us at the Hippodrome. The latent sentiment is
<span class="xxpn" id="p191">[p191]</span> in abeyance, like the pity which the Spaniards never feel at
their bull-fights, probably because the arenas are too vast.
A true pagan would probably congratulate himself upon the
freedom from emotion which, at the Hippodrome, leaves him
free to enjoy the essence of beauty. But we cannot all raise
ourselves to the level of this Olympian indifference; we do
not care to be cured of the pleasure we enjoy—contenting
ourselves with deploring, like Théophile Gauthier, “<em class="e000I2">d’être
si fort corrompus de Christianisme</em>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i215.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p192">[p192]</span></p>

<p>The Hippodrome regains all its advantages when it leaves
to the circus the exhibition of “expressive novelties,” which
must be seen close at hand, and contents itself with its
speciality of races: foot and horse races, chariot races,
“Berberini races,” processions, and pantomimes.</p>

<p>The race of riderless horses is one of the most attractive
spectacles one can possibly see, and it is easily understood
why the Italians with their artistic genius elected to close the
festivities of their carnival by this exciting contest.</p>

<p>Every one has read some descriptions of this hippique <em class="e000I2">fête</em>
which so greatly delighted papal Rome. For a fortnight
before the race the horses which were entered for it were led
out every morning to accustom them to the course, and corn
was given to them at the end of the Corso, near the winning
post.</p>

<p>On the day of the race, at four o’clock in the afternoon,
two cannon shots gave the signal. All the carriages at once
turned out of the road, the spectators fell back into two lines,
and a detachment of dragoons cleared the Corso at a rapid
gallop. The murmur of the crowd died away into a profound
silence.</p>

<p>The horses chosen for the race were held in a line behind
a cord stretched towards the column of the People’s Gate.
Their foreheads were decorated with plumes, which worried
their eyes by waving in front of them; golden spangles were
plaited into their tails and manes. Small copper plates and
leaden balls armed with steel points were attached to their
flanks and croups to goad them on their way; and the effort
to frighten them even led to light sheets of tin and stiff paper
being fastened on their backs, which, rustling and quivering,
<span class="xxpn" id="p193">[p193]</span> produced the discomfort of a rider without the drawback of
weight.</p>

<p>Before the cord fell, the animals, impatient to start, excited
by the crowd, uttered loud neighs, pranced about, and
produced a clamour which filled the Corso. It frequently
happened that one of them would knock its groom down
and rush amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>At last the senator of Rome gave the signal. A trumpet
sounded, the cord fell, the half-maddened horses started wildly,
urged on by the applause of the people as though by whips.
Usually the “Berberies” traversed the 800 fathoms of the
course in two minutes twenty-one seconds, that is to say that
they ran thirty-seven feet per second. In the confusion, if
one horse could overtake the competitor which preceded it,
it would bite it, kick it, and use every artifice to impede its
progress. The arrival of the horses was announced by
firing two cannon; to stop them carpets were extended
across the end of the street.</p>

<p>In later years the Corso was only a speculation of the
horsedealers. The Hippodrome revives the best days of
this Roman institution; the epoch when the first families
of Rome, the Barberini, the Santa-Croce, the Colonna, and
the Borghese entered their horses for the race, the champions
of their rivalries and of their colours. Since the managers
of the Hippodrome object to injuring the valuable beasts
they place in the arena, they have abandoned the practice
of harnessing them with spurs and spangles. It is really
bare-backed horses, free from all carnival disguise, which
they produce in the lists.</p>

<p>The animals have been trained for a long time, placed
<span class="xxpn" id="p194">[p194]</span> before the barriers with a whip to urge them to jump, guided
all round the ring by sentinels, who punished any deviation
from the course.</p>

<p>Now they know what they are expected to do, and as soon
as the bell rings they all start. They reach the barrier, their
manes flowing in the wind, their hoofs flying, terrible as the
tide, white as the surge which rises on the waves. Ἵππος
μετέωρος, said Pindar, describing a horse rearing. It is a
brilliant meteor which flies over the barrier, but it is also
a crest of foam.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i218.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And the pleasure of watching these riderless races is
augmented by the good faith, the honesty of the beast, which
cannot be suspected of corruption, which strives for victory only.
Neither crime nor death can stop them. M. Houcke has
told me that he has known some horses to be killed in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p195">[p195]</span> ring by their jealous rivals, and others after the victory have
died from fits of apoplexy when they had gone back to the
stables.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i219.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If the riderless horse is superb, it is certain that the
chariot, the ancient Greek chariot, immortalized by Homer,
is the most æsthetic frame for it. The other day I read a
commonplace remark from Madame Dacier, who has only,
and quite justly, seized the meaning of words in Greek.
“I do not understand,” she said, “why the Greeks, who
were so wise, should have used the chariot for so long a time—why
they did not see its great inconvenience. I am not
speaking of the difficulty of managing a chariot, although it
is far greater than of managing a horse; nor of the space
occupied by it: I only say that there were two men to
each chariot. These two men were important individuals,
both fit for war. Yet only one of them could fight. Moreover,
some chariots required not only two, but even three or
four horses for a single warrior—another loss which merits
attention.”</p>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p196">[p196]</span></p>

<p>The excellent Madame Dacier has forgotten one thing,
that the Greeks were devoted to beauty before everything
else. They liked the chariot, because the quadriga was a
superbly æsthetic picture—a moving pedestal for the hero.
So that the chariot was not only an engine of war in their
eyes; it was an object of luxurious pleasure. Do you
remember the beautiful descriptions of chariot-races which
fill the literature of Greece, and particularly the plays of
Sophocles?</p>

<p>Do you remember, amongst others, the account of the
tutor of Orestes? For my own part, I never witness one
of these heroic displays without the lines of the divine poet
recurring to my memory.</p>

<p>“At sunrise the chariot-races took place. Orestes appeared,
and with him many charioteers. One was Achean,
another from Sparta; two came from Lybia, true masters of
the reins. Orestes was fifth, with mares from Thessaly.
The sixth brought light chestnuts from Etolia. The
seventh was from Magnesia. The eighth, a son of Enia,
advanced with white horses. The divine Athene had sent
the ninth. Lastly, a Beotian mounted the tenth chariot.</p>

<p>“The heroes were standing, and when the lots had been
drawn and their places were assigned to them, they sprang
forward at the blast of the brazen trumpets. All together
they raised the beasts; they shook the reins; the arena was
full of the roll of their ringing chariots. And all mingled,
confused, lavished the whip to pass by the axle of some
opponent. And the breath of the horses, covered with
foam, the backs of the drivers, and the wheels of the
chariots. <span class="xxpn" id="p197">[p197]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i221.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“When they reached the last post Orestes grazed it
slightly with his axle. He slackened the reins, and gave
the wheeler his head. With his right hand he restrained the
other.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;He was preparing for the finish of the race. But
when he saw that only the Athenian was left, he made his
<span class="xxpn" id="p198">[p198]</span> whip whistle round the ears of his steeds, and sprang forward
behind his rival. The two chariots rolled on in front.
Alternately they passed and re-passed each other by the
length of a head. Upright in his uninjured chariot, Orestes
had successfully run in every race; but in giving the left rein
to the horse rounding the post, he struck the column. His
axle was broken; from the height of his chariot he rolled
entangled in the reins, whilst the frightened horses
tumultuously rushed into the arena.”</p>

<p>Pantomime—another ancient amusement—is the glory of
the Hippodrome as well as the races. All who saw it will
still remember the splendours of the <em class="e000I2">Chasse</em>. It seemed
difficult to find anything more brilliant, for there are not
many subjects which can be used for these grand spectacular
shows. When a <em class="e000I2">Roman Triumph</em> has been displayed, a <em class="e000I2">Nero</em>
with chariot races, a <em class="e000I2">Fête amongst the Rajahs</em> with rivulets
of precious stones, an <em class="e000I2">Arab Fantasia</em>, a fairy piece, and a
genuine <em class="e000I2">Congo</em>, the management must fall back upon military
pieces. But we live upon former triumphs, and the Hippodrome
dare no longer produce old-fashioned effects from its
storehouses.</p>

<p>The embarrassment of M. Houcke the manager, who
arranges his own plays, was therefore very great. The
resources of a large place like the Hippodrome vary from
one season to the other. Sometimes acrobats form the great
novelty, sometimes a troupe of vaulting clowns is the central
attraction. Lastly, the horses were there to be exhibited, so
that the director found himself obliged to select a military
pantomime.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i223.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>M. Houcke is a type, a true child of the stage. He has
<span class="xxpn" id="p199">[p199]</span> five or six brothers scattered through the world, all managers
of riding establishments. His father, under the name of
Leonard, was formerly proprietor of the Deux-Cirques before
the Franconi. He has taken M. Loyal’s place in the ring in
Russia, Germany, and Scandinavia. This will tell you, if
<span class="xxpn" id="p200">[p200]</span> heredity is not an empty word, that he is gifted with a large
amount of professional genius.</p>

<p>Moreover—and this does not spoil it—Houcke is very
knowing. His choice of the name of Skobelef, as the hero
of his last military <em class="e000I2">fête</em>, appears to me an excellent proof of
this acuteness. You may vainly search contemporary history
without finding the name of any other victorious general who
would command the sympathy of the Parisians.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Skobelef and Plevna, the Russians and the Turks! Houcke
had grasped his pantomime. The chief outlines of the plot
were quickly arranged, and M. Thomas, the former decorator
of the Théâtre Français and the Opera Comique, Houcke’s
right hand man left for Russia, with a great deal of money
in his pockets to buy weapons, costumes, sledges, moujiks,
drovskies, and snow.</p>

<p>He returned with all Russia in his trunks.</p>

<div class="caption">CHARIOT RACES AT THE HIPPODROME.</div>
</div>

<p>Picture to yourself, from one end of the arena to the other,
a parquet floor laid down, over which sledges and skaters
glided as though upon the Neva. In the first <em class="e000I2">tableau</em> the parqueterie
represented a high road, a post-station in the steppe.
The orchestra, which had reinforced its musicians by a choir
of genuine moujiks, was suspended above the buildings of the
Isba. The good people sang with those deep voices which
Agrenieff had already enabled us to hear, in their national
songs, some years previously at the Trocadero. They were
placed in a suitably decorated gallery, and when, accompanied
by bells, the moujiks chanted their national hymn—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="center"><em class="e000I2">Bojé tsara krani</em></p>

</div></div>

<p class="continue">one <span class="xxpn" id="p201">[p201]</span> really felt carried far away on the wings of the music.
During the singing I looked over towards the third places,
filled with the poorer people, who are less sceptical than the
others. Many of them were quite touched, their eyes were
glistening, their breasts heaving.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i227.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Whilst the bells and the moujiks were singing in unison,
the processions commenced to pass over the road. First
came the singers and wandering dancers, who followed the
army to the scene of war; then groups of officers, convoys of
prisoners, the fantastic gallop of an orderly; then, with a
bustle, a troïka, containing a tall man enveloped in a grey
pelisse. This was Skobelef, who had arrived to take
command of the army.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i228.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then we were transported before Plevna. The country
people were taking refuge in the town, carrying all their
wealth in their carts. They were just in time! the Russian
soldiers were at their heels! But they are only scouts. The
Turkish sentinels have seen them from the walls of Plevna.
<span class="xxpn" id="p202">[p202]</span> The alarm is given. A sortie is made, and they are surrounded.
Their case is not quite clear; their reconnaissance
has a fatal look of spying. The Turks prepare to shoot
them, when a thundering gallop shakes the floor. The
Cossacks have arrived at furious speed to rescue the
prisoners. Ah, the brave men! I always thought that a
candle diet developed heroism. With the thrust of a lance, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p203">[p203]</span> Turks are properly settled; a few of them run away in great
style, and succeed in re-entering the town. They merely
postpone the moment of surrender, for the whole Russian
army is advancing. It rushes to the assault of the practicable
places in the fort. In the midst of the engagement
and smoke the whole end of the Hippodrome becomes
<span class="xxpn" id="p204">[p204]</span> illumined with the lurid light of fire. <em class="e000I2">Vive</em> Skobelef! <em class="e000I2">vive</em>
Ruggieri! Plevna is burning! Plevna is burnt!</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i229.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And the victors have nothing to do but rejoice!</p>

<p>In a moment a painted canvas has been unrolled round the
arena, which represents St. Petersburg in perspective; the
parqueterie has changed into the frozen Neva. The whole
town has come out to greet the victorious soldiers!</p>

<p>A fine evening for skaters!</p>

<p>With the point of their skates, on the ice, in English, in
Italics, in Gothic, they write the name of Skobelef. Lamps
suspended to the arches reproduce the glorious word. The
sound of the clarions and fifes playing the triumphal march
is already heard.</p>

<p>The moment has come!</p>

<p>The leader of the orchestra lowers his baton.</p>

<p>One, two, three!</p>

<p>And as though the whole army, the whole people had been
stopped spellbound at this signal, the cannon thundered, the
orchestra bellowed, the fireworks, are let off, the bells ring,
and high above all the clamour the national hymn rises for
the last time—</p>

<p>Although <em class="e000I2">Buffalo Bill’s</em> company has not appeared at
the Hippodrome, this seems to be a fitting place in which to

have delighted the Parisians during the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The innumerable readers of Cooper’s American novels have
seen the prairie of the Sioux transported, with its actors and
its decorative accessories, to the Porte Maillot. All were
there: the Red Skins—genuine Red Skins, the mustangs,
<span class="xxpn" id="p206">[p206]</span> buffaloes, cowboys, vaqueros, waggons, tents, bows, arrows,
rifles, dogs, squaws, and papooses.</p>

<p>This extraordinary troupe was taken to Paris by Nael
Salsbury, a manager who is celebrated in every English-speaking
country. It is commanded by an extraordinary
man, Colonel W. F. Cody. Picture to yourself the most
perfect type of trapper that you can imagine after reading
<em class="e000I2">The Spy</em> and <em class="e000I2">The Mohicans</em>. Born on the frontier, brought
up on horseback, of chimerical courage, and unequalled skill
in the management of horses and firearms, Colonel Cody is
six feet high, and this fine body is crowned by the head
of a stage musketeer. His curling hair falls upon his
shoulders, and he has the moustache of an Aramis beneath
the straight classical nose of an American.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody’s warrior troupe has its female star, Miss
Annie Oakley, called the “infallible little shot.” She is also
a child of the frontier, where her name is as much feared as
her bullet. And in fact she has accomplished wonders. One
<span class="xxpn" id="p207">[p207]</span> day at Tiffin (Ohio) she hit a fifty-centime piece held between
a man’s finger and thumb at a distance of thirty feet.</p>

<p>In February, 1885, she fired at 5,000 glass balls, which
three projectiles threw up for her fifteen yards high; she
broke 4,772 of them in nine hours, although loading the
guns herself.</p>

<p>Miss Oakley manages a horse quite as well as a gun.</p>

<p>At a New Jersey fair she won four races out of five.</p>

<p>“And Miss Oakley is rendered still more interesting,” says
a biography from which I am copying, “by the fact that she
is short, and only weighs 106 lbs.”</p>

<p>Not one word more.</p>

<p>The young girl is still unmarried.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter IX. The Equilibrists." id="chapter-9">CHAPTER IX.
<span class="smaller">THE EQUILIBRISTS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The equilibrists are the most artistic acrobats, the true
Olympians.</p>

<p>The gymnast excites our admiration by the marvellous
development of his thorax and limbs, and by the epic relief
of his muscles. The equilibrist does not require the same
effort in his work. The beauty of the performance lies in
the delicacy, variety, facility, and grace of the artist’s movements,
and on this account women excel as equilibrists, for
men cannot reconcile themselves to the suppression of their
<span class="xxpn" id="p210">[p210]</span> strength in the feats they achieve, and therefore take a second
rank in equilibrium.</p>

<p>They prefer special branches of the art, and are usually
jugglers, bicyclists, or antipodeans.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>A proverb is current behind the scenes of the circus, to
the effect that love destroys the centre of gravity in tight-rope
dancers, and as a rule equilibrists—that is to say the
true artists, not the pretty girls who use the cord as a
springing-board—might rank with the Roman vestals. Their
reputation is their fortune, and they are carefully guarded by
their parents. It is not only a question of averting the danger
of maternity, which ends the artistic career of an equilibrist.
No risk must be encountered of anything that could damage
the artist’s health; and, therefore, those who are particular
on these points can enjoy the performance of an equilibrist
without any uneasiness about her private life.</p>

<p>The children of acrobats are equilibrists and jugglers from
their birth. Stroll into a circus some morning during rehearsal,
you will see all the corners filled with boys and
girls, who, on every tightened rope and round the iron bars,
are imitating the paternal exercises for their own amusement.
I remember, one day in London, witnessing a curious scene
in a seventh-floor garret. Under the roof two cords were
stretched across the attic; a young boy was practising
walking on one of them without a balance; on the other
a monkey was faithfully copying the gestures of his companion.
The professor had probably gone out to buy some
tobacco; in his absence the two dancers silently continued
their parallel work. I can tell you that acrobats learnt the
value of mutual instruction before the schoolmasters!
<span class="xxpn" id="p211">[p211]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i237.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The lowest step of equilibrist art is the <em class="e000I2">globe performance</em>.
Walking upon the rolling ball, forward or backward, vaulting
<span class="xxpn" id="p212">[p212]</span> and dancing upon it, are the
A B C of the profession. This
old-fashioned accomplishment
is, therefore, never used, unless
some new invention is added
to increase the difficulty.</p>

<div class="figleft size4">
<img src="images/i238.jpg" width="250" height="625" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This has happened with
Lady Alphonsine and the
Russian Frankloff, whom we
saw walking upon the water at
the Neuilly <em class="e000I2">fête</em>, standing upon
a ballast-tub, which he rapidly
turned round with his feet.
Lady Alphonsine ascended a
small spiral upon her globe.
It resembled the winding turn
upon a screw, and was twisted
round a mast fifteen or eighteen
feet high. The ascension is
not so bad, but I assure you
that the descent gives you some
trouble. It is necessary to
restrain the enormous wooden
ball, always on the verge of
escaping, and the feet patter
frantically, vibrating like the
sounding-board of a mandoline.
Here the effect produced
is out of proportion to the exertion forced upon the
artist; and this performance has another inconvenience: if
<span class="xxpn" id="p213">[p213]</span> it be continued for too long it spoils the shape of the leg by
undue development of the calf—two reasons why the globe
should not be reinstated in the esteem of the public.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i239.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE SLACK WIRE.</div>
</div>

<p>However, here as elsewhere, fashion rules the world, and
<em class="e000I2">tight-rope dancing</em>, after falling into abeyance for a time, is
now apparently returning to favour.</p>

<p>If, some fine morning, we may find ourselves globe spiral
ascensionists with little previous exertion, no one can become
a tight-rope dancer without much patient labour. You see
how easily the rope-dancer runs across her narrow path, and
may feel tempted to say, “Really, it only requires nerve to
do as much.” But it is a pity that, for your own edification,
you were not present at the artist’s first experiments.</p>

<p>All the strength of the dancer lies in the back and in the
rigidity of the legs. On this account children cannot be
placed upon the cord before they are ten years old. The
apparatus used in these performances is very simple, and
has not changed since antiquity. The cord is raised upon
“<em class="e000I2">croisés</em>,” two crossed sticks, at each end, which form two ╳
of different size. The ╳ at the back is the highest, so that
it may support the back of the dancer during the intervals of
rest. The second ╳, or “<em class="e000I2">croisé de face</em>” which bears the
“<em class="e000I2">guidon</em>” or <em class="e000I2">object of sight</em>, from which the dancer never
moves his eyes, is not higher than the cord, which is attached
at each end by cross bars of flexible wood. In Europe we
use the ash, but the Americans use a still more pliant wood,
the <em class="e000I2">ixry</em>.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus is fixed by an arrangement called
a “<em class="e000I2">cadrolle</em>” of pulleys. The first time the dancer attempts
to cross the cord he is supported by straps on either side.
<span class="xxpn" id="p214">[p214]</span> With the balancing-pole carefully held in both hands, his
eyes fixed upon the point of sight, he endeavours to turn
his feet out as much as possible, treading first on the heel
and then upon the great toe. After a few months’ practice
he can dance the “<em class="e000I2">sabotière</em>” which does not wound his still
tender feet. The other exercises which he must slowly
acquire are the <em class="e000I2">walk forward</em>, the <em class="e000I2">walk backward</em>, the
<em class="e000I2">dangerous spring forward</em>, the <em class="e000I2">dangerous spring backward</em>
the <em class="e000I2">horse spring</em>, and the art of <em class="e000I2">springing from one foot to
the other</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i242.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This is the classic series of exercises. When the dancer
has once mastered them his own imagination must aid his
performance. He must attempt some new feat upon the
cord that no one else has yet tried, and this “novelty” is
<span class="xxpn" id="p215">[p215]</span> more difficult to find than you would suppose. Artists like
Ada Blanche, who inherit the talents of Madame Saqui and
Blondin, have a right to repeat La Bruyère’s melancholy
words, “We have come too late.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i243.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have purposely given very little space in this book to
former artists. The skill of our living gymnasts, acrobats,
equestrians, and clowns, prevents our regretting the dead;
but amongst the arts practised in the circus, that of the
equilibrist has been in vogue longer than any other, and it
is also the most limited in its resources.</p>

<p>It is therefore expedient, Saqui, to place your charming
picture in this place, who forced the Great Emperor to raise
his eyes to watch your aerial exploits, whom he called his
<em class="e000I2">enragée</em>, whose chimerical daring he secretly admired for its
<span class="xxpn" id="p216">[p216]</span> resemblance to his own audacity. The astronomers of our
time, less gallant than the ancient poets, have not yet placed
you amidst the stars; yet, on the other hand, I fear that you
have not been received into Paradise: for, little pagan, you
once desecrated the sacred towers of Notre Dame with your
little sabots. May this sin be remitted some day! I know,
in one corner of Paris, an old centenarian Italian woman, who
still has masses said for the repose of your restless soul, and
believes that in expiation of your pride you are condemned
to wander for two hundred years between heaven and earth,
without any amusement except that of playing with the
rainbow as a hoop when there is no storm.</p>

<p>The pleasant memory of this peri is closely allied with the
name of Émile Gravelet, called Blondin. Is there any place
in the world where the famous crossing of Niagara has not
been spoken of? The two Americas hastened to see the
feat, and every day Blondin added some novelty to his
performance. Sometimes, seated on a little chair, he would
cook an omelet upon his cord, and eat it amidst shouts of
applause. Sometimes he took his son on his back and
ran from one bank to the other. One day Blondin caught
sight of the Prince of Wales amongst the spectators. He
was presented to him, and proposed that the Prince should
make the journey across the Falls with him. His Royal
Highness alleged that his rank obliged him to remain on
the bank.</p>

<p>This offer was one of Blondin’s favourite jokes.</p>

<p>Pierre Véron told me that on the day that the rope-dancer
crossed the Seine he suggested to Cham, who had come to
make a sketch, that he should cross with him.
<span class="xxpn" id="p217">[p217]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i245.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I am perfectly willing,” replied the caricaturist, “but I
will carry you on my back.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Monsieur Cham, you cannot think of doing
that!” <span class="xxpn" id="p218">[p218]</span></p>

<p>“You see you are the one to refuse,” coolly answered the
unsmiling jester.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i246.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The sudden discredit into which rope-dancing has fallen
during the last few years dates from the appearance of
Oceana.</p>

<p>This young woman, anxious to adopt a “novelty” which
<span class="xxpn" id="p219">[p219]</span> would exhibit her beauty without too much exertion, chose
a <em class="e000I2">wire</em>, which, hanging slacker than the cord, enabled her,
with a little oscillation, to assume the attitude of reclining in
a hammock, the voluptuous indolent postures of <em class="e000I2">Sarah la
baigneuse</em>. But the genuine rope-dancers at once determined
to reproduce all the exercises of the cord upon the wire,
which Oceana had so easily brought into fashion, and, with
the exception of the horse-spring, they can all be performed
upon it. The difficulty of preserving the equilibrium on a
support that is even more unstable than the cord delighted
the equilibrists.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i247.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A young Oriental, Lady Ibrahim, in the winter of 1888,
at the Folies Bergère, showed us the advantages a clever
equilibrist could derive from the flexibility of the wire.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i248.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i249.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A little too tall, with the almost thin arms of a dancer,
she allowed herself to be raised by one hand to a rather high
platform, from which she started, far above all heads. Once there,
she opened a Chinese parasol, which she used as a balance; then,
with a very serious expression, an anxious <span class="xxpn"
id="p220">[p220]</span> rigidity of the whole face, her eagle eyes
fixed on the point of sight, she stepped upon the wire, which,
brilliantly plated with nickel, looked like the slippery floor of
a skating-rink under her feet. When she reached the centre of her
wire, Lady Ibrahim caught a steel hoop in its flight; for one second
she placed it behind her head; it was the starlit night: then she
slipped it over her head, and slowly, with graceful precautions,
she made it glide down the whole length of her <span class="xxpn"
id="p221">[p221]</span> body to her feet. Some flags arranged in
a small wheel, so that their folds waved as she moved, afterwards
replaced the parasol in her hand, and then, suspended between the
draperies of undulating silk, Lady Ibrahim violently swung herself
from right to left on one leg; suddenly she closed her feet, raised
herself in the air on the points of her toes, turned, and went
towards the back <em class="e000I2">croisé</em>. The performance
was crowned by a promenade on a plank balanced on the wire. Lady
Ibrahim repeated upon the plank the various exercises that I have
already described, until at last, amidst loud <span class="xxpn"
id="p222">[p222]</span> applause, she picked it up and carried it off
upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>The wish to conquer increasing difficulties has raised the
equilibrists from the slack wire to the trapeze. The danger
of this work lies in the instability of the support. The slack
wire and cord are less steady than the ball; the trapeze,
although weighted by lumps of lead at the ends of the two
cords, oscillates perceptibly more than the cord.</p>

<p>It is like a thoroughbred, a nervous, supple, and rebellious
horse, which must be mounted with infinite care and delicacy
of movement. Therefore the equilibrists who have once tried
the trapeze will never abandon it. Through the meshes of
their net they disdainfully look down upon the poor slack
wire-dancers, who are with difficulty raised two yards above
the sand of the arena by the <em class="e000I2">croisés</em>.</p>

<p>Globe, cord, slack wire, trapeze—this is the complete cycle,
and we have already seen that these graceful exercises are
performed chiefly by women. A man has not the same
æsthetic reasons for exhibiting his body in a work which
provides no use for his masculine strength, and he therefore
rarely leaves the “carpet;” he is a <em class="e000I2">juggler</em> or an <em class="e000I2">antipodean</em>.
All the <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> juggle, and all their children too. It is
their leisure work between the exercises that exhaust their
strength. They sit in a corner, pick up whatever is near
their hands—a key, an orange, a stone—and throw them into
the air. But daily practice is necessary before they can
surpass the average skill and attain the dexterity which
excites our wonder on the stage.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i251.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The true juggler, who is usually left-handed, never juggles
on horseback, nor on a cord or trapeze; he performs with
<span class="xxpn" id="p223">[p223]</span> balls standing on the ground. This is a speciality of the
Japanese. One was seen this winter in drawing-room
performances whose dexterity approached sorcery. He only
used a large white ball and a small red one, but in his hands
they seemed like living things. They ran over his face, up

a finger.</p>

<p>Our friend Agoust was celebrated in America as a juggler
before he became a comic clown and manager of the Nouveau
Cirque. I have seen him juggle simultaneously
with an egg, a ball, and a
bottle of champagne; and this is a
miraculous feat, through the difference
in the muscular effort required in
throwing back each object as it falls
into the juggler’s hand.</p>

<p>The Dane Sévérus is also one of the
present celebrities of carpet equilibrism.
He appears on the stage like Hamlet,
in a black velvet tunic. One expects
him to commence the monologue spoken
on the terrace of Elsinor. No. He
orders a small velvet chair to be brought
to him, and perches himself upon it head
downwards, feet in air. But he has first
balanced a lighted lamp, with its glass
and globe, upon the nape of his neck.
He then moves it forward upon his skull
by tiny jerks of the skin of the hair.
It reaches his forehead; from there it
travels down his profile, and finally descends
to his chest.</p>

<p>This Sévérus has made a speciality of
juggling with fragile objects. He replaces balls and knives
by basins, salad-bowls, lamp-glasses, and plates of all sizes.
<span class="xxpn" id="p225">[p225]</span> Whilst seeing his performance one cannot but regret having
left the cook at home, instead of giving her one good lesson in
the art of skilfully handling a dinner-service.</p>

<p>Sévérus has a remarkable <em class="e000I2">iron arm</em>. The biceps of the
arm develop very strongly in jugglers, and the crural
muscles attain an extraordinary expansion and strength in
the <em class="e000I2">antipodeans</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> use this term for the jugglers who work
with their legs. For instance, the Japanese Yotshitaro and
the Mexican Frank Maura.</p>

<p>I have seen Maura perform one of the most extraordinary
bounds that I ever witnessed on the stage. It did not excite
much applause from the audience, who little suspected the
immense force of the exertion. Frank Maura knelt at the
edge of the stage, seated himself upon his heels and crossed
his arms, then, without assisting himself by one movement of
the bust, by one effort of the loins he threw his body into the
air, and did not return to the ground until he had completed
the revolution of a dangerous somersault.</p>

<p>After seeing the performance of this antipodean, one can
understand the wonderful vigour of his muscles.</p>

<div class="figleft size4">
<img src="images/i254.jpg" width="250" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Frank Maura places in the middle of the theatre a metal
handle about two yards high, which supports a small saddle.
The equilibrist balances his shoulders and nape upon it,
and then raises both legs at a right angle. An assistant
throws to him successively three enormous balls, a barrel, and
a bench long enough to seat six persons. Maura catches
these objects, throws them into the air, recatches them, passes
them from his hands to his feet, turns them violently round
and then suddenly stops their rotation from time to time.
<span class="xxpn" id="p226">[p226]</span> With this extraordinary strength
the faculty of “prehension” is
so curiously developed amongst
antipodeans, that many of them
can pick up a ball or an orange
with their feet, and throw these
objects, like a projectile, towards
a given mark.</p>

<p>We must add to the group of
equilibrists two classes of acrobats,
whose appearance in the
Hippodrome dates from the
grand spectacular pantomimes
which rendered it necessary to
cover the arena with a <em class="e000I2">parqueterie</em>
floor. These new comers
are <em class="e000I2">bicyclists</em> and <em class="e000I2">skaters</em>.</p>

<p>The bar used to guide the
bicycle was certain to attract the
attention of the equilibrists sooner
or later, and we can understand
how the idea suggested itself of
reproducing upon this unsteady
support some of the exercises
which the gymnast performs upon
the fixed bar. Since the number
of these borrowed “acts” is
necessarily very restricted, the
wish to introduce variety into
his “novelty act” led the bicyclist to add a companion to his
<span class="xxpn" id="p228">[p228]</span> performance, who springs upon his shoulders whilst he is in
motion, and executes there some of the acrobatic feats which
the pad equestrians perform in the <em class="e000I2">pas de deux</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i255.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The summit of the limited performance possible on a
bicycle is attained when the artists attempt on a <em class="e000I2">monocycle</em>
the exercises which are now frequently seen on the two
wheels.</p>

<p>As for the skaters, they appear upon the <em class="e000I2">parqueterie</em> in
order to provoke laughter by their falls; their performance
belongs to comic acrobatics.</p>

<p>You who in former days have tested the asphalte of the
Skating Rink in the Rue Blanche, with your shoulders, back,
and knees, are well acquainted with the horrible sprains which
followed your attempts.</p>

<p>The clown-skaters have found means of avoiding those
inconveniences by the suppleness of complete dislocation.
At the same time they make great capital out of the natural
perversity which impels us to laugh at our neighbours’ falls.
I shall not astonish you when I tell you that these comic
equilibrists are looked down upon by “professionals.” They
are held a little aloof, and are regarded as entertainers rather
than artists. For they have not been forced to conquer an
enemy in whose defeat lies all the glory of an equilibrist—the
vertigo.</p>

<p>Can we say that the equilibrist is really victorious over the
vertigo? After much observation I am convinced that it
would be more accurate to write that the vertigo conquers
the equilibrist.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i257.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>You all know the experiment which plunges a hen into a
state of immobility and renders it more or less completely
<span class="xxpn" id="p230">[p230]</span> insensible by placing its beak upon the ground and drawing
a straight chalk line towards which its eyes forcibly converge.
In the same way, if any one take a brilliant object
between two fingers and hold it a few inches from the eyes
and a little above the forehead of a somewhat nervous person,
first engaging him to look at it fixedly and to concentrate his
attention on what follows, there is every chance of sending
the person who is victim of the experiment into an hypnotic
sleep.</p>

<p>The series of phenomena which then take place are familiar
to all:</p>

<p>First, the eyes water a little through the fixed gaze, the
pupils dilate and contract alternately, the members become
extended, rigid, in some degree cataleptic.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Now recall the succession of acts which the equilibrist
accomplishes in his work. He too, fixedly, obstinately gazes
upon a single spot—the point of sight. All those who perform
upon the cord have acknowledged that the same peculiar
phenomena are produced at the end of the first seconds of
this intense gaze; the equilibrist feels a sensation of <em class="e000I2">absolute
isolation</em>, and at the same time a curious <em class="e000I2">attrahent</em> feeling
towards the point of sight. In this nervous state the muscles
assume a species of rigidity which assists the acrobat in his
work.</p>

<p>Must we then conclude that the phenomena found here
border upon hypnotism? This is a delicate question. I know
that it will soon be laid before the Académie de Médecine by
two clever <em class="e000I2">savants</em> of the Faculty of Montpellier. I commend
these remarks to their attention, for they may feel some
interest in them, owing to the difficulty which impedes close
<span class="xxpn" id="p231">[p231]</span> observation of these wandering artists, whose confidence is
so hard to win.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i259.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Those who study this question of hypnotism amongst
equilibrists should notice:</p>

<p>1. That as a rule they are <em class="e000I2">female subjects</em>,</p>

<p>2. That the most skilful equilibrists come to us from the
land of the fakirs, from India, Japan, the East;</p>

<p>3. That all the European subjects that attain exceptional
dexterity are at least neurolopathic.

</div>

<p>To quote but one instance: Erminia Chelli, the queen of
equilibrists upon the trapeze, is a natural somnambulist.</p>

<p>From May till July, 1887, Paris possessed this charming
<span class="xxpn" id="p233">[p233]</span> young girl at the Cirque d’Été, and her departure has left
us inconsolable.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the emotion which her performance
caused me at our first meeting.</p>

<p>I at once begged M. Franconi to introduce me to her
father.</p>

<p>M. Chelli and I exchanged cards.</p>

<p>I have copied the document here as an extraordinary
monument of acrobatic and paternal pride:</p>

<div class="poembox">
<div class="fsize2">
 EMILIO CHELLI,
 <span class="smaller">EX-ARTIST, GYMNAST, AND CLOWN,</span>
 FATHER
 <span class="smaller">OF THE CELEBRATED AERIAL EQUILIBRIST,</span>
 <span class="smaller">SIGNORINA ERMINA CHELLI.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The wife’s card said “Madame Mère.”</p>

<p>Erminia Chelli is not more than nineteen; she is a
Venetian, and by lengthening her legs in the trapeze she
has acquired the supreme grace in walking, the elegant
proportions, which are usually rather lacking in Italians
The bust is youthful yet charming, the neck delicate; the
little dark head is proudly carried upon shoulders which the
trapeze has rendered supple without unduly developing the
shoulder blades. Since the appearance of Oceana no one
of such perfect proportions has been seen in either of the
circuses or the Hippodrome. The beauty of Oceana was,
perhaps, a little more individual and original; but Erminia
is better bred and more typical.
<span class="xxpn" id="p234">[p234]</span></p>

<p>“She is her father’s pupil,” Madame Chelli, her mother
informed me, as she assisted Erminia in putting on a large
pelisse. “She began to appear in public when she was quite
a little girl.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i262.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As she spoke an equestrian came in to tell them that
the net was being prepared for Mademoiselle Chelli’s
performance.</p>

<p>Erminia threw off her mantle, and with the caressing tones
<span class="xxpn" id="p235">[p235]</span> of a young girl, a little seriously and gravely, she went up
to her mother and put her arms round her neck:</p>

<p>“Addio, mamma,” she said, kissing her.</p>

<p>A little surprised, I inquired:</p>

<p>“Is this a superstition, Madame Chelli?”</p>

<p>“No one knows,” the mother answered. “It has been
her custom since childhood.”</p>

<p>Truly, in spite of the net extended beneath her, she might
well be excused, poor little girl, for having one moment’s
uneasiness whenever she was fetched for her dizzy work on
the trapeze.</p>

<p>For one whole month I strained my neck watching her
extraordinary performance in the friezes. Without the
assistance of her hands, which she used as a counterpoise,
she bent low enough to pick up with her teeth a handkerchief
laid upon the trapeze. She mounted a ladder which
was only poised upon the round oscillating piece of wood.
Lastly, she balanced an immense ball still upon this frail
support, and then, without leaning upon anything, she
mounted upon it. And thus, lost in space, the globe
beneath her feet, she seemed, the little acrobat, so
beautiful, so unconscious of danger, like a goddess
travelling through the air with the earth for a movable
pedestal.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which I had praised the beauty and
talents of Erminia Chelli in several newspapers procured for
me at that time the letter which I reproduce here with great
pleasure. It is from a literary man, and throws a genuine
light upon the customs of some of those acrobats who as a
class are so misunderstood by the public.
<span class="xxpn" id="p236">[p236]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<em class="e00S02">Sir</em>,</p>

<p>“The article in which you allude to Mademoiselle Chelli
recalls to me a souvenir which I have much pleasure in
relating to you.</p>

<p>“Three or four years ago the Chelli family came to Vichy
and took part in the performances at the Eden Theatre. The
father went through some acts of strength and equilibrium;
the daughter was commencing on the flying trapeze the work
for which she is now distinguished. The mother watched
them both, admired them, and trembled.</p>

<p>“At that time the child, who might have been fourteen
years old, already placed a ball upon a movable trapeze,
steadied it as far as possible with her feet whilst holding
by the cords, then loosening her grasp of the cords, she rose,
bowed, stood upon one foot, and threw kisses to the crowd,
visibly directing some of them towards her mother, who
usually occupied the second chair in the second row of the
orchestra stalls; the first chair being reserved for the child,
who came back to her mother as soon as her performance
was over.</p>

<p>“My usual place was in the first chair in the first row. I
soon began to talk to the mother and her daughter, whose
modest manners and childish affection for her parent were
perfectly free from all affectation, and attracted me immensely.</p>

<p>“One evening I ordered a bouquet to be thrown to
Erminia as she left the trapeze. On the following day I
asked her mother if this attention, which the audience warmly
applauded, had pleased her daughter.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! yes,’ she said, ‘and this morning Erminia carried
it to the Virgin’s chapel.’
<span class="xxpn" id="p237">[p237]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i265.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“‘She is pious, then?’</p>

<p>“‘Certainly; it is only a fortnight since she received the
communion; she often communicates.’
<span class="xxpn" id="p238">[p238]</span></p>

<p>“I will not point out the contrast which presents itself to
the mind. There are some facts like the drop of water, in
which, as Mademoiselle de Gournay has already said, the
whole sun is reflected.</p>

<p>“Poor child! has she travelled so far in safety on the rough voyage
of the life which she leads? I hope so; it is the sincere wish of an
old and unknown friend.</p>

<p class="right">“<em class="e00S02">C. Livet.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>The “old and unknown friend” of Erminia Chelli may feel
reassured. I have eaten macaroni in the society of Mademoiselle
Erminia and her family, and since her departure
from France we live in the friendly intercourse of letters:
the pretty equilibrist is still just the same as when he knew
her. The horse filled the thoughts of poor Émilie Loisset,
and so the trapeze fills the whole life of Erminia Chelli. It
is her vocation; when quite small she would go under the
table and swing her dolls upon a trapeze made of a hairpin
and the elastic from her hair net. And, on the other hand,
whenever she is not in the circus she passes her time in
making bonnets for herself and her friends. This talent
for millinery replaces Ingres’ violin. One has much more
chance of pleasing her by saying, “How becoming your
bonnet is, Erminia!” than by complimenting her upon her
talent as an equilibrist.</p>

<p>Erminia is likely to amass a very large dowry. Do you
know that £120 per month may be earned by walking head
downwards upon the ceiling of a circus? In four or five
years’ time she will marry.
<span class="xxpn" id="p239">[p239]</span></p>

<p>“But there is no hurry,” she said, shaking her head, when
some one mentioned this contingency to her.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i267.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>She was right. The sight of her youthful form flying
through the friezes is a delight to those pagans who appreciate
pure curved lines, and it is also a subject for meditation
to those philosophers to whom the little acrobat unconsciously
gives a symbolic lesson when she has exhausted in an ascending
<span class="xxpn" id="p240">[p240]</span> scale of difficulties all the most unexpected combinations
of equilibrist art, upright upon her globe, supported by the
trapeze only, she pauses, and upon this vantage point of
unsurpassable perfection, feeling sure that nothing more is
possible, she smiles, sends a kiss from the tip of her fingers
to her admirers, then abruptly, as though struck by lightning,
she falls into the net.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter X. The Gymnasts." id="chapter-10">CHAPTER X.
<span class="smaller">THE GYMNASTS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The tragic accident which killed an unfortunate equilibrist,
Castagnet, by a fall from his cord in September,
1888, roused great emotion amongst the public. Those
persons, even, who wrongfully credit the poor acrobats with
practising every vice, cannot restrain their admiration for the
marvellous courage which these pariahs display on these
terrible occasions. We must take advantage of the intervals
thus produced in the contempt usually felt by the public for
circus artists, to prove to all lovers of fine physical performances
that this great skill is not acquired without the practice
of many daily virtues, of which temperance ranks least, and
incredible perseverance is the most admirable.</p>

<p>I have now frequented the society of <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> for many
years, and am on confidential terms with them; I cannot assert
<span class="xxpn" id="p242">[p242]</span> too often the very great esteem I feel for them. Their art
is wholly traditional, and it preserves habits of respect and
obedience in their families which, perhaps, can scarcely be
found elsewhere. Of course there are some black sheep in
the band, some slave-drivers, like the bully whom Nils
Forsberg formerly painted in a picture—<em class="e000I2">Avant la ’Loi Talon</em>—which
caused a great sensation in Paris, but the subject of
it appeared so cruel that the committee dared not admit it to
the Salon. But this is an exceptional case, which is much
less common than is usually believed. The “families” whom
you see pirouette in the arena, vault over fixed bars, and
scale the trapezes, keep, as a rule, to the old patriarchal
customs. Rehearsal fills every hour of the day which can
be spared from the theatre, and this muscular work produces
a healthy physical fatigue, which is the best school of morality.</p>

<p>The first business of a family of acrobats that wishes to
succeed in its tour round the world, is to perfect each member
of it in some special exercise which suits his natural aptitudes.
Some men are born <em class="e000I2">carpet</em> acrobats, others are attracted by
the <em class="e000I2">fixed bar</em>, others seem born for <em class="e000I2">vaulting</em>. No mistake
must be made at the <em class="e000I2">début</em> of a professional education, for
an artist who wishes to acquire fame and fortune must
become a specialist from his first teeth.</p>

<p>Whatever branch may be decided upon, the carpet acrobats,
the bar experts, and the trapezeist have always commenced
by training themselves in a certain number of universal
exercises which form the basis of gymnastics, as the scale is
the basis of all music.</p>

<p>They consist in learning the innumerable number of
somersaults. <span class="xxpn" id="p243">[p243]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i271.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first attempted with the <em class="e000I2">feet firm</em>, that is to say without
springboard or <em class="e000I2">batoude</em>, is the <em class="e000I2">somersault backward</em>. This
is much easier to learn than the <em class="e000I2">somersault forward</em>. The
neophyte wears a strong tight belt provided with a ring
above each hip. Cords are passed through these rings, and
are held by two companions in work, enabling them to uphold
the gymnast. The latter strives to turn round upon the axis
formed by the two cords, gradually decreasing his reliance
upon them. At last he can dispense with them entirely.</p>

<p>Before the acrobat attempts the <em class="e000I2">somersault forward</em>, he
must go through the whole series of <em class="e000I2">exercises in posturing</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p244">[p244]</span> First <em class="e000I2">bending forward</em> or “posturing,” the hands laid flat upon
the ground so as to support the body, which is raised with
the legs opened, the first time in the form of a Y, the second
time in an elongation of I.</p>

<p>Then comes <em class="e000I2">bending backward</em>, in which the body is arched
in an inverse sense, the hands on the ground near the heels.</p>

<p>Next follows the <em class="e000I2">curvet</em>, which is performed by throwing
the body suddenly backwards until the hands touch the
ground. And at the moment they reach the floor a vigorous
relaxation of the muscles of the legs makes the acrobat
rebound upon his feet.</p>

<p>When any one has mastered these three primeval exercises,
he may attempt the <em class="e000I2">somersault forward</em> without the aid of
his hands. He must now rely upon combining these various
acquirements in “acts” of his own invention that will dazzle
and astonish the public.</p>

<p>The classical performance of a carpet acrobat opens by
<em class="e000I2">bending backward</em>. It is continued by a <em class="e000I2">monkey’s somersault</em>—a
decomposition of the somersault backward, by the <em class="e000I2">rondade</em>—a
curvet backwards, and then by a <em class="e000I2">somersault</em>.</p>

<p>But vaulters do not end here; each of them varies in an
infinite number of ways by the acts of his invention, the
outline of his acrobatic career. He introduces an <em class="e000I2">Arab
somersault</em> (a somersault from the side, which is obtained by
starting from the ground on one foot only); the <em class="e000I2">lion’s
somersault</em>, which is a <em class="e000I2">monkey’s somersault forward</em>; the
<em class="e000I2">coward’s leap</em>, in which the acrobat, lying upon his back,
raises himself by one effort of the loins; the <em class="e000I2">forward
somersault</em>, a <em class="e000I2">lion’s somersault</em> without the hands, which
throws the man, legs in air, head downwards upon the nape
<span class="xxpn" id="p245">[p245]</span> of his neck; the <em class="e000I2">carp’s leap</em>, also the sudden spring of an
extended acrobat, which raises him to his feet through the
relaxation of the muscles of the spine.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i273.jpg" width="340" height="680" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">double somersault</em> cannot be performed from the
carpet without assistance; the artist must spring from the
shoulders of a companion, or with the aid of the peculiar
spring-board which French <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em> call the <em class="e000I2">batoude</em>. With
<span class="xxpn" id="p246">[p246]</span> the <em class="e000I2">batoude</em> Auriol cleared twenty-four bayonets with a <em class="e000I2">flying
somersault</em>, ended by a <em class="e000I2">dive</em>—a jump from a great height.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
With the <em class="e000I2">batoude</em> specialists have bounded over twenty-four
horses, and at the gymnasium Du Marais, belonging to
M. Pascaud, last year an amateur, M. Mars, performed a
<em class="e000I2">triple somersault</em>.</p>

<p>This feat is the realization of the highest ambition of those
carpet acrobats whom you have so often seen grouped in an
apotheosis in one of those <em class="e000I2">human pyramids</em> which rise in a
second through the strength of the gymnasts’ biceps, and
which fall to pieces like fireworks, in rockets of somersaults.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i274.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We cannot leave the circus floor without allusion to a series
of individuals who exhibit themselves by the side of the
genuine acrobats in performances of a special kind.</p>

<p>These are the <em class="e000I2">contortionists</em>, the india-rubber women—all
those who were formerly known by the more general name
of <em class="e000I2">boneless</em> acrobats. These boneless or dislocated performers
are more numerous in the world than one would imagine.
<span class="xxpn" id="p247">[p247]</span></p>

<p>Ballet-dancers are all dislocated, for their feet, legs, and
loins have been disarticulated to obtain <em class="e000I2">beautiful points;</em> the
naturalist quadrille-dancers from Mabille, who are now seen
at the <em class="e000I2">café</em> concerts, are also dislocated.</p>

<p>There are some naturally disarticulated men. All Parisians
will remember in their youth, a beggar who was celebrated as
the “humpback of the Pont d’Austerlitz.” This mountebank
caused his hump to pass from his back to his chest as he
liked. The vertebral column turned without any effort from
back to front, and from front to back again. He was found
drowned one day between two coal boats, and his skeleton
is still shown in the Museum.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i275.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But he was an exception. One must begin early in
order to manufacture a dislocated man like the “man in the
ball.”</p>

<p>A wooden ball, about one yard in diameter, is rolled into
the arena. This huge sphere ascends an inclined plane, and
rolls from right to left upon it, then descends and recommences
the ascension like a living being. And truly, for it
suddenly opens and a dislocated man appears, who, without
any semblance of fatigue, bows to the astonished audience.

</div>

<p>No one has yet guessed the secret which enables this
wonderful contortionist to bend and move his body in so
small a space. The bones, instead of being joined by
articulations, are held together by a fibrous membrane which
envelops them like a kind of muff and holds them in their
sockets. This membrane, called “a capsule,” is very flexible,
<span class="xxpn" id="p249">[p249]</span> and is capable of great elasticity of tension, during childhood
particularly. By preserving and developing this natural
disposition, the abnormal movements can be obtained which
surprise us amongst acrobats.</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i277.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The performances of Walter, called the <em class="e000I2">Serpent-man</em>, are
not less extraordinary.</p>

<p>I will not insult you by supposing that you have not seen
and applauded this wonderful artist; it is, therefore, for the
<span class="xxpn" id="p250">[p250]</span> inhabitants of hyperborean countries that I shall now describe
his work.</p>

<p>J. H. Walter appears in black tights spangled with silver,
classic as an Antinoüs, nervous as a stag. He looks as
though he could reach the friezes with a bound, and one is
quite surprised to find that he does not leave the “carpet.”
His performance opens by an important and novel act, in
which the bust is reversed, and the head touches the back of
the knees, whilst the right hand seizes one of the ankles, and
the left is extended in an inverse sense, flat upon the ground.
And the startling series of leaps, of movements, of contortions,
which follow, end in an alarming pose, which recalls
the monstrous gargoyles of Gothic sculpture; for the acrobat
drops his feet, knots them under his head, and in this
attitude, with starting eyes, and rigid, open lips, he resembles
a skull supported on cross-bones.</p>

<p>When we were introduced to each other, I complimented
him upon his artistic skill.</p>

<p>J. H. Walter seemed pleased with my praises; his British
stiffness thawed, and we chatted familiarly.</p>

<p>I was very curious to know whether this acrobatic monstrosity
had attracted much notice from the women. He
frankly replied—</p>

<p>“Sir, the chastity which monks do not always observe is
forced upon an artist of my class. You will guess that I did
not obtain this complete flexibility in one day. On the very
morning of my birth my father commenced to bend my joints.
I grew up with the idea that I would be the greatest disarticulated
artist of the century, or perhaps of all ages. I
never had any other ambition. With regard to the point on
<span class="xxpn" id="p251">[p251]</span> which you question me, the greatest reserve is imposed upon
me. I have all the appearance of a strong man; my chest is
wider than your own, but beneath it I conceal the lungs of
a child; they are stunted by the daily pressure of my thoracic
cage. Consumption threatens me, and will carry me off very
early unless I break my neck in the circus some evening,
which I should certainly prefer.”</p>

<div class="figleft size5">
<img src="images/i279.jpg" width="190" height="475" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The acrobat told me all this without any affectation, in so
natural and decided a tone that I did
not feel justified in pitying his fate. But
since I wished to know what sentiment
could survive, in a being of such mediocre
intellectual culture, his resignation
to the sacrifice of life, I said to him
with some interest—</p>

<p>“I quite understand; dear Monsieur
Walter, that the applause you receive
seems to you, whilst it lasts, a sufficient
reward for your past sufferings and
approaching end. But, tell me, when
the fever of the circus has passed away,
in your hours of leisure and solitude
like this one, do you not curse your
destiny?”</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled quietly.</p>

<p>“I have,” he replied, “a specific
against <em class="e000I2">ennui</em>—a passion which saves
me from reflection. I gamble, sir,
gamble madly for whole nights at a
time. I stake the thousands of francs which the managers
<span class="xxpn" id="p252">[p252]</span> pay me every month; worse than that, I have staked my
skeleton, and lost it!”</p>

<p>The terrace of the <em class="e000I2">café</em>, where we were talking, had become
empty through the lateness of the hour; the waiters had
already closed the front, and were taking in the chairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i280.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Serpent-man rose; and as I stared at him with wonder
in my eyes, he added—</p>

<p>“We are driven from here, sir. Will you accompany me
to my hotel? I will tell you how it occurred.”</p>

<p>He led me to a family boarding-house in the Rue du
Colisée, which has no customers except the acrobats who
pass through Paris. J. H. Walter occupied a fairly comfortable
room on the first floor. He lighted a lamp, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p253">[p253]</span> when we were seated, facing each other, he continued his
story in these words—</p>

<p>“It happened about five years ago I was performing in
London, and every evening I played poker in the taverns
with an ill luck that would not change. All my savings
were lost, and when I had no money left the idea occurred
to me to insert an advertisement in <em class="e000I2">The Era</em> (you know that
is our professional newspaper), in which I said—</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i281.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“‘<em class="e000I2">J. H. Walter, the celebrated Serpent-man, will dispose
of his skeleton upon his death for one thousand guineas,
payable at once.</em>’</p>

<p>“On the following day I received a visit from a celebrated
surgeon. He made me undress, carefully examined
<span class="xxpn" id="p254">[p254]</span> my back, felt the vertebræ of my spine, then drawing out a
pocket-book, he handed me a cheque for a thousand guineas
without a word!</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i282.jpg" width="340" height="476" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Alas! my ill-luck still pursued me, and the money soon
followed my wages.</p>

<p>“It is now eighteen months since I lost the last guinea of
the surgeon’s money on the card-table. But if the treasure
has gone, the contract still stands. In obedience to a formal
clause in the agreement, I always travel with this.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>

<p>The Serpent-man rose, went to his bed, and, stooping
down, he drew a long, narrow oak box from under it. An
<span class="xxpn" id="p255">[p255]</span> address was painted in large black letters upon this queer
violin-case—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem" id="DOCTORaddress">
<p>DOCTOR
 <span class="em6under">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p id="em10">

 <span class="em6under">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p id="em16"><em class="e000I2">London.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>The acrobat raised the lid, and I saw that the box was
empty.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, “is my coffin; I always travel with it.
Now, when I break my neck, I shall be hurriedly embalmed
and packed into it. You see this paper gummed inside
the box? It contains instructions from the doctor himself,
written in four languages, for the undertakers, who will lay
me out. Look, here are the directions.”</p>

<p>The Serpent-man stooped down with the lamp in his hand;
I knelt beside him, and read—</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">The persons who place the acrobat, J. H. Walter, in this
coffin, are begged to inject a solution of chloride of mercury and
acetic acid into his veins, according to the method used by the
American, Doctor Ure.</em></p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">In default of the above, an injection of about four quarts
and a half of sulphate of zinc may be used. The latter is even
preferable, if the coffin will be more than forty days on the
road.</em>”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the acrobat when I had finished reading,
“what do you think of it all?”</p>

<p>“I think, my friend, that you must have been tempted
more than once to leave this box in the cloak-room.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p256">[p256]</span></p>

<p>I smiled as I spoke, hoping to induce the Englishman to
speak out; but the Serpent-man replied rather dryly—</p>

<p>“No, sir; such a temptation has never occurred to me:
a gentleman keeps his word.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i284.jpg" width="340" height="680" alt="" />
</div>

<p>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The performance of carpet acrobatics is something
like a state of larva to gymnasts. They all aspire to take
flight.</p>

<p>The first step in this elevation is the “bars.”</p>

<p>The second, the glorious altitude, is “vaulting.”</p>

<p>Any one who has put on the belt of a gymnast, if but for
<span class="xxpn" id="p257">[p257]</span> one trial, has practised on the single bar the following
rudimentary exercises:—</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i285.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. <em class="e000I2">Breasting the bar</em>, which consists in gently drawing the
body, without jerking it, to the level of the bar, by the
contraction of the biceps.</p>

<p>2. <em class="e000I2">Circling the bar</em>—curling the body gently over the bar
head forward, holding tightly with the hands.</p>

<p>3. <em class="e000I2">Simultaneous “upstart”</em>—the elevation of the body
<span class="xxpn" id="p258">[p258]</span> above the bar, with both arms through a spring from the
back—“<em class="e000I2">temps de reins</em>.”</p>

<p>4. <em class="e000I2">Alternative “upstart”</em>—one arm after the other.</p>

<p>5. <em class="e000I2">Upstart on one leg</em>, which has a corollary called <em class="e000I2">German
upstart</em> or <em class="e000I2">swinging</em>.</p>

<p>6. “<em class="e000I2">Cutaway up</em>,” which is obtained by giving a strong
spring, which throws the body forward, brings it back again
in a natural swing, and is completed by an “upstart.”</p>

<p>7. <em class="e000I2">Long swings or giant swings, forwards and backwards.</em>
This is a series of rapid somersaults round the bar, executed
with extended arms. At times they are so rapid that the
body describes a succession of circles round the bar, like the
arms of a windmill.</p>

<p>8. <em class="e000I2">Hough swings.</em> This exercise resembles the preceding
one, but the bar is grasped below the kneecaps, without the
assistance of the hands.</p>

<p>9. <em class="e000I2">Hands and feet swings.</em> This is performed backwards
or forwards; the hands and feet are both placed on the bar,
the hands outside, the feet inside.</p>

<p>This is a fairly complete list of the exercises of an amateur,
but very few of them practise the whole series. They pause
at the “upstarts,” and at once pass to the <em class="e000I2">double bars</em> or
<em class="e000I2">parallel bars</em>, which possess the hygienic virtue of widely
opening the chest and developing the biceps.</p>

<p>Circus gymnastics usually commence with the <em class="e000I2">triple
parallel bars</em>. There are a few acrobats who perform with
the single bar and a <em class="e000I2">double “batoude</em>,” but I have only seen
one specialist with the <em class="e000I2">parallel bars</em>—Gustave de Penthièvre,
who is rarely seen now in the hippodromes.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i287.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the <em class="e000I2">triple parallel bars</em> offer signal
<span class="xxpn" id="p259">[p259]</span> advantages for acrobats, through the opportunities they
provide for numerous and very varied exercises. They
enable several gymnasts to appear together, and thus give
<span class="xxpn" id="p260">[p260]</span> the artists breathing-time whilst their companions perform
their share of the entertainment. These frequent intervals
of rest are indispensable, on account of the exhaustion which
follows the violent exertions of the gymnasts.</p>

<p>The series of acrobatics performed upon the fixed <em class="e000I2">triple
bars</em> are called passes.</p>

<p>Amongst them you will find all the exercises of the single
bar perfected, enlarged, and multiplied—the <em class="e000I2">simple swings</em>,
<em class="e000I2">demi-pirouette swings</em>, <em class="e000I2">swings on the feet</em>, <em class="e000I2">swings standing</em>,
<em class="e000I2">vaulting acts</em>, <em class="e000I2">hands and feet swings</em>, <em class="e000I2">hough swings</em>, <em class="e000I2">somersault
swings</em>, <em class="e000I2">heel swings</em>. Sometimes the artist raises himself,
sits on the first bar, opens his legs and profits by the impulse
thus received to spring forward upon the other bar (<em class="e000I2">vaulting
act</em>); sometimes he springs in recoiling, and then turns upon
himself to catch the next bar facing him (swing upon the
heel); but it must be understood that each acrobat has his particular
acts which are combinations of these exercises suited
to his dexterity and personal strength, and blended with
various <em class="e000I2">falls</em>, <em class="e000I2">somersaults backwards and forwards</em>, <em class="e000I2">double
somersaults forwards</em>, <em class="e000I2">double reversed somersaults</em>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">fixed bar</em> is also the best school of <em class="e000I2">vaulting</em> or <em class="e000I2">flying</em>.</p>

<p>Before Léotard invented the <em class="e000I2">flying trapeze</em> by a stroke of
genius, <em class="e000I2">vaulting</em> exercises were restricted to the <em class="e000I2">river jumping</em>.
Acrobats have now rejected with some contempt the two
cords which held them prisoners by the wrists; to-day, they
are masters of space.</p>

<p>This subject reminds me of the modern kings of the
trapeze—the two brothers Volta.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i289.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE HANLON-VOLTAS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.</div>
</div>

<p>These gymnasts belong to a good family. They were
educated in England in one of those country colleges where
<span class="xxpn" id="p261">[p261]</span> English boys develop the lobes of their brains and the biceps
of their arms at the same time. Thanks to this system, my
two friends, although they are the kings of the fixed bar, can
also read the <em class="e000I2">Iliad</em> in Greek with great facility.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i291.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They both worked in a bank, and in the evenings, after
dinner, they practised gymnastics for their amusement in a
public gymnasium. Naturally supple fine young men, they
made wonderful progress. A “manager” who accidentally
saw them perform, proposed making an engagement with
them. They consulted each other. They laboriously earned
600<em class="e000I2">l.</em> per annum between them in the bank. Now the
Barnum offered a salary of 160<em class="e000I2">l.</em> per month.
<span class="xxpn" id="p262">[p262]</span></p>

<p>The brothers Volta closed their books, crossed the ocean
with a somersault, and made their <em class="e000I2">début</em> in America. They
joined a band which already possessed two <em class="e000I2">flying trapezists</em>
and an <em class="e000I2">iron arm</em>, the Hanlons, the genuine pupils of the old
Hanlon-Lees. The Voltas’ contributions to the entertainment
was a very clever series of performances on the <em class="e000I2">fixed bars</em>.
This completed the scale of vaulting exercises. The band
could make the tour of the world in glorious style with the
varied accomplishments of its members.</p>

<p>With the exception of the standing swing and the feet
swing, all the exercises of the <em class="e000I2">fixed bar</em> can be performed on
the trapeze. Some special swings are also risked, such as the
<em class="e000I2">passe ventre</em>, which is executed by throwing one’s self over the
trapeze. But the most popular of these exercises is the
simple flight from one trapeze to the other, with a few yards’
interval to be crossed between them. This infatuation is
explicable, for there is no doubt that this performance gives
us the best opportunity of admiring as in apotheosis the
beauty of the human form, and this is the reason why the idea
of placing young girls upon the trapeze was so quickly grasped.
With the advent of woman, passion and crime made their
appearance in the serene atmosphere of the aerial realms;
which, like the republic of Aristophanes’ <em class="e000I2">Birds</em>, extend beyond
the reach of human perversity. You have all felt the anxiety
which seizes the heart during the <em class="e000I2">flight supported</em> (<em class="e000I2">voltige en
porteurs</em>), when one of these young girls hangs by the feet to
her trapeze—hushes the music, and in the sudden silence calls
to her companion—</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Are you ready?</em>”</p>

<p>The youngest of the two acrobats is mounted upon her
<span class="xxpn" id="p263">[p263]</span> saddle; with eye and muscle strained she watches the trapeze,
which advances towards her in waves of rhythmical movements
approaching nearer each time.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i293.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly the word is given—</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Go!</em>”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i294.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The youthful body launched by the trapeze like a stone
from a sling, crosses the whole width of the circus, and the
<span class="xxpn" id="p264">[p264]</span> flying girl clasps the hands of her companion. The shock
causes the two bodies to sway together for an instant, then
they free themselves, and with a double somersault reach the
net. You can imagine how easily a jealous girl can rid herself
of a rival in those few minutes. An imperceptible
movement of the loins, the delay of one-tenth of a second,
and the girl flying through space is condemned to death.
This misfortune recently happened through an accident, but
there are some criminal cases of it. One of these incidents
has been related already. The two heroines were called
“Ohia” and “Nella.” The advertisement styled them
“sisters,” but they were only companions in their aerial work.
They detested each other with the indescribable artist-jealousy,
in spite of their entry hand in hand and their stage
smiles. It happened that the applause was warmer for Nella,
the vaulter, than for Ohia who caught her; and on this
<span class="xxpn" id="p265">[p265]</span> account the miserable girl hated her companion so intensely
that she resolved to kill her.</p>

<p>One day, therefore, when after the great spring Ohia
grasped Nella by her hands, an abrupt movement suddenly
precipitated the young girl outside the net.</p>

<p>Fortunately the shock was not too violent to allow Nella to
catch hold of the cord as she fell. She remained suspended,
dazzled for one moment, clinging to the saving line.</p>

<p>Ohia was still swinging in the friezes. Warned by the
shouts of the audience that her scheme had failed, she made
one tremendous spring, traversed the whole width of the
circus, and fell shattered upon the palisades of the arena.
Thus another proverb, also current in the side-scenes of the
circus, was verified, and this time the whole world may take
warning from it—“If you value your bones, never work with
wine or with a woman.”</p>

<p>I once questioned some celebrated acrobats upon a subject
which piques the curiosity of the public.</p>

<p>We all know by experience that Eves love well-made
Adams. I do not mean the “mashers” with girls’ faces, but
men built like the old statues, with supple limbs and broad
chests. From this point of view, the gymnast who acquires
strength without losing his agility, seems an ideal lover. I
therefore asked them to tell me in friendly sincerity if they
found many scented notes in their dressing-room every evening.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” replied Alphonse, the elder of the two friends,
the orator of the pair, “that we receive quite as many love-letters,
as the tenors do. From this you may conclude, if you
like, that there is exactly the same number of practical women
as of sentimental ones, unless the same individuals write to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p266">[p266]</span> tenors and the gymnasts—and this seems very probable to
me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i296.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“And in what terms do you answer these passionate advances,
my dear Alphonse?” <span class="xxpn" id="p267">[p267]</span></p>

<p>“We throw the letters into the fire without reading them,”
replied the acrobat.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i297.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You are afraid of being tempted?”</p>

<p>“Of course all excess is forbidden us. No one must
mount into the friezes without a perfectly clear head. It is
too easy to miss a spring and break one’s neck, even by
falling into the net—which is more useful for reassuring the
audience and the police than for anything else. But this is
not our only reason for avoiding women. Ask Adolphe’s
opinion on the point.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p268">[p268]</span></p>

<p>“We do not like women because they are badly made,”
replied his comrade, with a grimace of disgust.</p>

<p>I could not help smiling.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i298.jpg" width="450" height="360" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Well, my friend,” I replied, “I think you are speaking of
them like a jealous artist; you object to them because, with
very limited skill, by the exhibition of their bodies flying
through the air they attract as much applause as you do with
all your artistic dexterity. It is not personal dislike in your
case, as you seem to think—it is trade jealousy.”</p>

<p>At this Alphonse interposed.</p>

<p>“Adolph is right,” he answered. “Women are badly
made. A woman is not an object of art, but of use. Look
at her hips—how they exceed the falling line of the shoulders,
crush the short legs and destroy all proportion by their excessive
width. This defect requires concealment by some drapery,
<span class="xxpn" id="p269">[p269]</span> and should prohibit the exhibition of the nude. On the other
hand the strength of the body, which in a woman lies in her
hips, a man carries in his shoulders. Atlas bears the weight
of the world upon his neck. Get up, Adolph, and show us
your back.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i299.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>His friend was smoking, but he quietly laid down his
cigarette, and took off his shirt. Alphonse looked at him for
an instant, admiring him with the enjoyment of an artist, a
smile on his lips.</p>

<p>“You can put that fellow,” he said, “into the ideal oval of
the egg upon which Greek sculpture has inscribed the hermaphrodite,
and you will see whether his shoulders destroy
the classic lines of sexless beauty.” I have often heard these
æsthetic truths expressed by other trapeze artists more
coarsely and with less appreciation of art.

<p>After an interval of some centuries, the life of the gymnasium
has revived the customs which astonish modern
readers in the <em class="e000I2">Banquet</em>. This surprise is unworthy of philosophers.
It is logical that throughout all ages the same
causes should produce the same effects. The woman of
antiquity remained in the gynæceum, and she was rarely seen
by the outer world.</p>

<p>Woman is banished from modern gymnasiums by her
natural destination of wife, mother, and nurse.</p>

<p>The Greek youth became enamoured of the <em class="e000I2">ephebe</em> in the
gymnasium, where they appeared nude and beautiful.</p>

<p>Modern gymnasts admire their fellow-workers in their
<span class="xxpn" id="p271">[p271]</span> dangerous performances with equal enthusiasm. And it would
show little knowledge of human nature if we inquire how the
admiration for beauty becomes transformed into the wish to
possess it, that is, into love.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">

<p>I write the word without fear of any misunderstanding.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i303.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We are now contemplating simple, healthy men who pass
<span class="xxpn" id="p273">[p273]</span> their lives in performing very hard work, and who are freed
from sensual temptation by physical fatigue. As a rule,
<span class="xxpn" id="p274">[p274]</span> therefore, the passions of gymnasts are purely sentimental and
platonic; you will find in them first of all the great element
of all love—the protection of the weak by the strong. There
is, in fact, in every pair of acrobats, a male and a female, the
“hero” or bearer, the “man underneath” who supports the
weight of the whole “act,” to whom the “man above” confides
his life. The latter is the younger, the most supple and
graceful of the two. He receives the larger share of the
applause, the most enthusiastic “bravos.” His existence
depends upon the self-sacrifice and affection of the man who
upholds him.</p>

<p>“We must rely upon each other,” said one of the Hanlons
to me one day, referring to their young comrade, “Bob,” the
favourite of the whole troupe.</p>

<p>Translated:</p>

<p>“We must love each other like the youthful soldiers of the
Theban legion, like Castor and Pollux, to whom legend has
never assigned any mistress.”</p>

<p>This conviction of the superior, absolute beauty of man
is so bound up in the customs of the gymnasium, that you
will find that all men of high culture who devote themselves
to physical exercises, acquire with their attachment
to the trapeze, the same æsthetic views. The most illustrious
example that I can quote on this point is certainly Pierre
Loti.</p>

<p>You have read his novel of <em class="e000I2">Azyadé</em>, and you know the
enthusiasm with which he speaks of the gymnasium. Remember,
on the other hand, the tenderness of the novel-writer
for <em class="e000I2">Frère Yvres</em>, recall the <em class="e000I2">Pêcheurs d’Islande</em> clinging
to the helm of their boat, and you will more easily realize the
<span class="xxpn" id="p275">[p275]</span> discipline by which gymnastics lead an acrobat who cares for
his profession, to the æsthetic admiration for man.</p>

<p>For my own part until I read the works of Pierre Loti, I
never thoroughly understood the epithet which Pindar throws
in the face of an Olympian victor in a lyrical antistrophe—</p>

<p>“Oh, barren gymnastics!”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter XI. The Clown." id="chapter-11">CHAPTER XI.
<span class="smaller">THE CLOWN.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">The clowns are the most popular
members of the motley crowd
that attracts the audience of the circus,
hippodrome and other places of amusement,
where strength and beauty form
the basis of the entertainment. Their
pirouettes fill the house, they are the
“attraction,” the great success of the
programme. As they are not very
numerous, for there are not more than
thirty of them scattered over the globe,
<span class="xxpn" id="p278">[p278]</span> the directors compete for them at very high salaries. Like
the star-tenors they contract engagements for many years in
advance, and receive the emoluments of an ambassador, and
their requirements increase with their success. I am told by
the agents that their commissions have never been so high as
in the last few years.</p>

<p>Although much appreciated in France, the clown is not a
creation of the Latin genius. It only invented the three
personages of the comedy <em class="e000I2">dell’arte</em>, the three typical masks
from which every expression of the human face arise: Pierrot
the coward, Arlequin the crafty, and between them, the
perverse Columbine. During many centuries these three
puppets have moved through every shade and variety of
psychological pantomime.</p>

<p>At the present time Italian pantomime is an extinct art. In
the time of Watteau the poor masks had already lost their
definite outlines, and their idiosyncrasies had become misty
and dim. They are now effaced, dispelled by the cloud of
powder which the clown, launched from the other side of the
Channel, scattered in the air as he tumbled upon the French
stage.</p>

<p>Etymologically the clown is the rustic, the rough peasant,
pugnacious, ignorant and silly, who enlivens the sombre
dramas of Shakespeare by his foolish quibbles. In England
this ludicrous personage was the indispensable accessory of
every play; he is nearly related to the French Jocrisse, who
also wears the garb of a well-to-do countryman, and is equally
ridiculed by the city folk.</p>

<p>The Shakesperian clown has not yet disappeared. He is to
be found with all his traditional attributes in the three
<span class="xxpn" id="p279">[p279]</span> companies of Hengler’s Circus, which travel all over England,
and at Christmas time give simultaneous performances in
London, Liverpool, and Dublin.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i309.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I remember entering the arena of this national circus one
Sunday morning in London, and being considerably surprised
to find the whole company in morning dress assembled in the
ring. A black-coated individual, Bible in hand, was addressing
the acrobats. He was a clergyman. I have been told since
that Mr. Hengler exacts punctual attendance at the Sunday
services from every member of his troupe.</p>

<p>In this traditional house, the Shakesperian clown, the <em class="e000I2">jester</em>,
as he is called in the profession, appears in white tights,
<span class="xxpn" id="p280">[p280]</span> ornamented with blue or red patches indiscriminately arranged,
with a short drapery round the hips, and a fool’s cap on his
head. Thus attired, he does not caper and joke, but declaims
passages from Shakespeare and sings Irish songs which delight
the public in the cheap places.</p>

<p>You can easily imagine that such a figure could not be
moved from its native surroundings. The dialect of Old Tom,
the tirades of King Lear, would not please any audience,
except in the United Kingdom. Some other work must be
found for foreign engagements.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">jester</em>, therefore, looked round to see if he could not
gather some useful hints from his stage companions, that might
help to fill his travelling bag, and naturally he studied the
coloured <em class="e000I2">minstrels</em>. It is impossible to write a serious history
of the clown without making some allusion to these negro
singers. The modern clown, acrobat, magician, and pantomimist
was produced by the union of the <em class="e000I2">jester</em> and the
<em class="e000I2">minstrel</em>.</p>

<p>Lovers of old books, who strolled round the Quai Voltaire
last winter may have noticed in the window of a dealer in
curious prints, a collection of bad chromolithographs from
New York which attracted and amused the passers by. They
depicted the misfortunes of “coloured men,” caricatured by
their old masters; ridiculous falls into buckets of water; a
horse kicking a negro in the jaw; a gun exploding, blows a
negro into a thousand pieces like Captain Castagnette. The
mouths with their gleaming teeth are always split by a foot
placed across them, the legs are thrown above the woolly
heads in grotesque dances, which seem performed in rhythm
to the blows of a whip. These coarse pictures were not signed
<span class="xxpn" id="p281">[p281]</span> by the artist, they bore the names of the publishers only,
Currier and Ives of New York.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i311.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>English pantomime, the extraordinary pantomime of the
Hanlons, Pinauds, Renards, Leovils, Ramys, and Leopolds,
is considerably influenced by these slave gaieties, by the
monkey-like tricks of the negroes capering for the amusement
of their cruel masters.</p>

<p>Freedom has been granted, the whip no longer inspires the
<span class="xxpn" id="p282">[p282]</span> epileptic dances of the blacks, but their jerky gambols so
greatly diverted the “massa,” that they have survived slavery
itself in an essentially American and English institution: the
<em class="e000I2">Christy Minstrels</em>.</p>

<p>Visit <em class="e000I2">music halls</em> you will find on occasional stages a curious
chorus of men in evening dress, sitting in a semicircle, their
faces blackened with soot. In St. James’s Hall the effect
is particularly curious, for it is here that Messrs. Moore and
Burgess, who have carried negro minstrelsy to the highest
perfection, exhibit their company of coloured minstrels. The
back of the stage is occupied by the orchestra. From an
artistic point, no pains is spared to seek out and engage
the best musicians who come before the public both vocal
and instrumental. Among the vocalists may be reckoned
some of the finest voices obtainable in England or in America.
The singers are seated in a semi-circle, the comic men are
placed at either end of the row, and these furnish the life and
humour of the entertainment; they are the comic vocalists,
the propounders of quips and tellers of droll stories; their
instruments are the bones and tambourines.</p>

<p>They play, sing, dance a jig and make jokes. This is the
duty of the two leaders of the band, the jester and his
butt.</p>

<p>Messrs. Moore and Burgess confine their well-recognised
original Christy Minstrel Entertainments to the St. James’s
Hall. It is the key-note of their programme that they “never
perform out of London.” On the other hand, their commonplace
imitators become out of the London season itinerant
humourists.</p>

<p>In the summer you will find them on the sands
<span class="xxpn" id="p283">[p283]</span> of every sea side town. Banjo in hand, arrayed in the cotton
trousers worn by the old slaves, always accompanied by the
black dress coat, an eyeglass in one eye, straw hats on their
blackened heads, they call themselves the <em class="e000I2">Ethiopian serenaders</em>.
They travel in bands and perform in the open air.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i313.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Very agile and supple, they repeat in violent dances a
<span class="xxpn" id="p284">[p284]</span> species of gymnastics which a little resembles the “<em class="e000I2">chahut</em>”
of the lower classes in France. The great “split” is as familiar
to them as the somersaults, etc; and these two exercises form
the greater part of the pantomime, which the minstrels perform
when they are tired of playing on the banjo.</p>

<p>The acrobatic success of the minstrels pointed out a road
for these clowns, who were anxious to place a girdle of
somersaults round the terrestrial globe. The pirouette had
the advantage of being understood by the spectators in every
land.</p>

<p>The clown therefore started without any other luggage.</p>

<p>This English emigration dates from about 1865. This was
the time of the clever entries of vaulting clowns, who starred
the whole ring with their capers. They vaulted from the
“carpet,” and from the great and little <em class="e000I2">batoude</em>, that is to
say, performed a somersault from a spring-board over a wall
of horses.</p>

<p>In the course of his travels the <em class="e000I2">jester</em>, now an acrobat,
learnt the idiom of several countries. From a few words interspersed
through his performance, he at once saw that his
English pronunciation easily roused the laughter of the
audience. His accent amused the Parisians particularly, and
he thought that great capital might be made of his broken
French, and a large salary earned whilst sparing his physical
labour. The corporation at once divided into two branches.</p>

<p>The clowns who found that their inclinations prompted them
to become “patterers” renounced the “carpet” and the
“spring-board” to speak to the public.</p>

<p>Those whom gymnastics had fascinated turned towards
acrobatic pantomime.
<span class="xxpn" id="p285">[p285]</span></p>

<p>And here we must weave a crown of laurels and immortal
flowers for Billy Hayden, the incarnate type of a patterer
clown, and you may be sure that some day his place in the
history of the stage will be quite as important as that of the
late Deburau.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i315.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Billy related the history of his life to me. He was born in
Birmingham, and his vocation dates from his early childhood.
He was one day mounted upon his father’s shoulders to watch
an acrobat performing in the open air, who ascended a movable
perch. The spectacle made a deep impression upon the
<span class="xxpn" id="p286">[p286]</span> child, and nothing could prevent him from following his
vocation.</p>

<p>Billy is a pupil of the minstrels. At the opening of his
career, he travelled through the world besmeared with black.
In Germany, the idea first occurred to him to powder himself
like Pierrot, and at once found that the change produced a
great success. The clever expressive features previously
concealed by the soot were suddenly disclosed by the powder.
And the audacity of the clown increased with the encouragement
of public applause.</p>

<p>Nearly all the jokes with which he has amused us are
borrowed from the minstrels. They always repeat the scene of
a jester and his butt, the stock-in-trade of the old show. At
the circus, the ring-master is the butt, the sensible man who
corrects the childish nonsense of the clown.</p>

<p>The clown Footeet plays one of these traditional scenes
very naturally. Mounted upon a horse, with his face to the
tail, he calls out:</p>

<p>“Oh, this horse hasn’t got a head.”</p>

<p>The ring-master gravely answers:</p>

<p>“It is on the other side, clown.”</p>

<p>“Turn it round then.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible, clown, you must turn round yourself.”</p>

<p>Footeet prefers vaulting to talking. But Billy Hayden is
as lazy as his donkey, and prefers jokes to somersaults. His
repertoire includes an amusing story of a stolen child.</p>

<p>When the star equestrian dismounts from her horse, Billy
turns to M. Loyal and says:</p>

<p>“Môa aussi, jé été oun cholie pétit démoisel.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p287">[p287]</span></p>

<p>“Allons donc! clown!”</p>

<p>“Vô n’étiez pas là quand jé suis né? Môa, j’y été. Alôrs
jé dois savoir mieux que vô!”</p>

<div class="figcenter size4">
<img src="images/i317.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And in a lamentable voice he relates the misfortune which
befell him:</p>

<p>“Labonn’ mé proménait dans oun vouâture d’enfant, et ell’
<span class="xxpn" id="p288">[p288]</span> s’assoit sur le bi-du-bout-du-banc à causer avec oun militair’.
Et alors oun vieil’ sorcière é venue avec oun pétit garçon. Et
ell’ a pris môa la choli pétit’ fill’ de la vouâture d’enfant’, et ell’
a mis à la place môa, le vilain petit garçon, dans la vouâture
d’enfant. Et depuis ce temps-là jé oun souis vilain pétit
garçon!”<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>With this Billy draws out an indescribable pocket-handkerchief
and bursts into tears.</p>

<p>Those whom this clown does not amuse, who prefer drama
to comedy, will reserve their approbation for the acrobat-clown,
who has inherited the genius of the Hanlon-Lees.</p>

<p>This radical transformation of style tempted the <em class="e000I2">jester</em> by
many advantages: first, by replacing words by gestures, it
suited the natural taciturnity of the Anglo-Saxon character,
which cannot dispose of the resources of Italian loquacity;
then it evoked great applause by the unexpected contrast
between the somersault suddenly executed precisely according
to rule, following the ridiculous knockabout performance of
the tumbling scenes.</p>

<p>In making this evolution the clown exposed himself to the
danger of being confused with the professional gymnast whose
exercises he reproduced. This danger however was more
<span class="xxpn" id="p289">[p289]</span> apparent than real. The work of a gymnast is of a special
traditional character which no whimsical variation is ever
allowed to tamper with. Its immediate aim is the display of
daring movements and harmonious attitudes of the human
body, and above all it is a plastic performance. The clown’s
art, on the contrary, should aim at evoking laughter, not
applause. It appeals less to the sense than to the intelligence,
and, unlike gymnastics, it is not confined by classic fixed rules.
It has the right to follow the wildest fancies of a whimsical
imagination. It is not a Greek art, but an English one, and
it reflects all the most curious characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon
people.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i319.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p290">[p290]</span></p>

<p>The prevailing note in the Anglo-Saxon character is melancholy.
This produced the spleen, the gloomy ideas and the
systematic calculated first tinge of madness which the English
themselves call “eccentricity.” To this habitual sadness the
Anglo-Saxon joins a certain brutality, which is visible in all
his games, sullies all his pleasures, and even gives to his vices
a peculiarly sombre hue. In England gymnastics are cultivated,
not for the beauty which they bestow upon the body,
but for the murderous weight which they give to the fists
of a boxer. England is the cruel country, where men first
formulated the law of the “struggle for life.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i320.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="xxpn" id="p291">[p291]</span></p>

<p>The clown, the direct son of the Saxon genius, said to
himself:</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i321.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“To please my fellow-countrymen, who worship strength
more than anything else, I must first of all be strong, before
I can excite their admiration. I will therefore commence by
developing my muscles. As to my pantomime, if I wish it to
succeed, it must, by the incoherence of its actions, the whimsicalness
of its pointless gestures, the automatism of its movements,
imitate the terrible spectacle of insanity.”</p>

<p>With this idea, the English clown has adopted a mourning
livery of black and silver, and has broken the powdered mask
<span class="xxpn" id="p292">[p292]</span> of Pierrot by two red spots, two bloody patches; the insignia
of boxing and of English consumption.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i322.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This gloomy clown crossed over to France upon the
steamers that carried Darwin’s books and the commentaries
of Schopenhauer. For one hour the French imbibed the
sadness of their insular neighbours, the black acrobat was well
received.</p>

<p>Every one will remember the welcome which the Magiltons
and the Hanlon-Lees received in Paris. It was the first time
<span class="xxpn" id="p293">[p293]</span> we had seen English pantomime. The exotic art upset all
our ideas of logic, it was in direct opposition to all our innate
taste for clearness and delicate performances. However, it
succeeded, for it evoked the only laughter of which we were at
that time capable, a laughter without merriment, convulsive,
full of terror.</p>

<p>The Hanlon-Lees! How many pleasant artistic feelings
the name evokes in the memory of Parisians. The troupe is
scattered now, throughout the world, there are the Hanlon-Lees
on one side, the Hanlon-Volta on another, three of the brothers
are dead, and their comrade Agoust has abandoned them to
become manager of the Nouveau Cirque.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i323.jpg" width="340" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This intelligent and amiable man, who intends some day
writing the memoirs of his eventful life, has told me the details
of the history of the Hanlon-Lees—their true history, not the
account of them which you will find in a little book published
under the title of the <em class="e000I2">Memoirs of the Brothers Hanlon-Lee</em>,
<span class="xxpn" id="p294">[p294]</span> with pretty illustrations by Regamey and a splendid preface by
the master, Theodore de Banville.</p>

<p>The six brothers Hanlon, Thomas, George, William, Alfred,
Edward, and Freddy, first met Agoust in Chicago, about 1865.
They were then working as trapeze and carpet acrobats.
Thomas and Alfred, two splendidly built men, were the
“underneath men,” the carriers in the pyramid. The other
brothers were—rather puny; they always wore double
tights. Under the silk tights—worn outside—was another
suit, called in the acrobatic vocabulary, a <em class="e000I2">thirty-two franc</em>. In
the place of muscles this suit was arranged with fine woollen
fringes, which were carefully combed upwards so as to obtain
good curves; and one of the favourite jokes amongst artists, is
to stick pins, provided with little white flags, into these false
muscles.</p>

<p>At Chicago the Hanlons were vaulters, and Agoust juggled.
A tight-rope dancer, and Tanner with his dogs, had joined the
company, but the entertainment was still too short.</p>

<p>Agoust, who had been manager of the Young Henry Theatre,
pantomimist and leader of the ballet, suggested to the Hanlons
that they should perform a pantomime. He made them
rehearse two old pieces by Deburau, <em class="e000I2">Harlequin Statue</em>, and
<em class="e000I2">Harlequin Skeleton</em>. The experiment succeeded, and in 1867
the little company went to Paris, where it made its reputation
by the pantomime of the <em class="e000I2">Village Barber</em>.</p>

<p>The war of 1870 divided every one. The Hanlons returned
to America with the Strandges company, which had
been installed at the Châtelet. Agoust enlisted in a marching
regiment.</p>

<p>They met again in 1876, at the Walhalla in Berlin. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p295">[p295]</span> Hanlons were trying to mount a scene borrowed from the
minstrels, the celebrated <em class="e000I2">Do, mi, sol, do</em>. They were made up
like negroes.</p>

<p>“What can you do in this piece?” they asked Agoust.</p>

<p>He replied, “You have no conductor. I will place myself
in the desk.”</p>

<p>The five Hanlons then accepted their old comrade as a
partner in the place of their brother Thomas, who had died in
America. Thomas Hanlon had fallen at Cincinnati whilst
making the <em class="e000I2">spring for life</em>, and had broken his head against the
balustrade. It had been mended somehow, but he suffered
intense pain when his brothers jumped with both feet upon
his head. He had complained, saying that he could not bear
it, but he still continued this performance. At the end of a
few months he went mad.</p>

<p>The brothers Hanlon were always a band of terribly hard
workers. Every day, except Sunday, they rehearsed from
ten in the morning, till two—and from four till six in the
afternoons. When they were tired of vaulting they sat down
and worked mentally.</p>

<p>“My boys, never drink before a performance,” George (the
leader) would say to them. “After it is over, do whatever
you like.”</p>

<p>The Hanlons were Irish, and were supposed to drink deeply
sometimes after leaving the theatre. But if there were
excesses they were utilised, for when they met on the following
day, they related their dreams to each other and endeavoured
to construct a play out of them.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Do, mi, sol, do</em> met with extraordinary success at the
Folies-Bergères. The Hanlons had been engaged for one
<span class="xxpn" id="p296">[p296]</span> month at a salary of £360, but the first evening after the
performance, they signed an agreement for £600 per month,
and played their pantomime for thirteen months running.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Do, mi, sol, do</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Journey in Switzerland</em> were performed
in Belgium and England with extraordinary success.
In the latter country Agoust separated from his companions.</p>

<p>English pantomime does not require any tragic incidents in
order to fill us with admiration and wonder. We have
lately seen two companies of artists in Paris, the Leopolds
and the Pinauds, who recalled the best days of the Hanlon-Lees.
I am thinking chiefly of the Pinauds, who are exceptionally
clever. I made the acquaintance of these three
talented American actors whilst they were at the Folies-Bergères.
They are not brothers, but friends, and they are
thorough gentlemen. I say this quite earnestly, for if you
<span class="xxpn" id="p297">[p297]</span> meet them in the American Minister’s drawing-room you will
not feel at all surprised to find them there.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i329.jpg" width="450" height="563" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They are devoted to their art, extol it with much enthusiasm,
and discuss it like artists who have deliberately adopted
it, and who exert all their inventive faculties in the production
of their pantomime and in bringing their unique idea into full
relief. I saw this strange performance several times running
and should find great difficulty in analysing it. It consists of
a series of disjointed actions placed side by side, accompanied
by rapid changes of costume, mad pursuits, and grotesque
disguises.</p>

<p>A gentleman is playing a guitar, but he is constantly
<span class="xxpn" id="p298">[p298]</span> interrupted by the entry and exit of strange individuals leading
animals, which are all musical instruments. Everything is
musical in this pantomime—the pig that the peasant drags after
him, the carriage of the cannon with which a malefactor fires
a shell at the back of the guitarist. The last part of the farce
<span class="xxpn" id="p299">[p299]</span> is filled with the misfortunes of the peasant with the pig.
In the first place the rustic is roughly attacked by a bull,
which aims violent blows at his umbrella with its horns.
The peasant valiantly resists the blows from the horns and
tail of the animal, drives it off, and proud of his victory, sits
down to rest with a triumphant air. But, alas, an ill-disposed
jester sets fire to John Bull’s hat, it explodes like a petard and
flies into the friezes. In despair the peasant lifts his arms to
heaven. His prayer is answered immediately. As though the
ceiling were a horn of plenty, a rain of hats and caps descends
upon the stage. But they are the crushed shabby hats of
bookmakers and poor Irishmen, a lot of those formless head-gear,
which are only seen in London, where the workman has
no distinctive head-dress, but puts on the cast-off garments of
<span class="xxpn" id="p300">[p300]</span> the rich, thus giving to his poverty the appearance of a masquerade.
The peasant quickly tries on about twenty of the
hats, but not one of them fits his head. Again he lifts his
arms to heaven with a gesture of despair, and the curtain
falls.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i332.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With the mania which we Frenchmen have of insisting
that everything should have a meaning in spite of all appearances,
I asked the Pinauds what their pantomime signified.
“Absolutely nothing,” replied one of them. “On the contrary,
we try to destroy all connection between the scenes of our
entertainment. We only wish to produce upon the audience
the impression of violent terror and madness. And therefore
we represent a man, alarmed by the successive apparitions of
animals which play music when they are touched.” I listened
<span class="xxpn" id="p301">[p301]</span> quietly, but I could not help remembering the invariable
question, which I had heard the doctor at the police station
ask the drunken maniacs whom the police had picked up in
the streets—</p>

<p>“You see beasts, do you not, animals that swarm round
you?”</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i333.jpg" width="340" height="272" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They all reply in the affirmative, hanging down their heads.</p>

<p>These drunken hallucinations, these apparitions of animals,
are the framework of the English pantomime, the terrible
visions of a gin-drinker who has rolled into a gutter at the
door of a drinking bar.</p>

<p>The Craggs, “gentlemen acrobats,” also appeared at the
Folies-Bergères.</p>

<p>They came from New York, where they had made a great
success. They had also made large profits during their six
<span class="xxpn" id="p302">[p302]</span> weeks’ engagement, for they received 100 dollars a night.
They enter the stage in Indian file, all the seven, wearing
evening dress and white ties. They come forward in a line to
the front of the stage, and bend their heads; you think that
they are going to bow, simply like you or I. Instead they
make a somersault. Seven somersaults forward. They are
so quickly executed that every one present asks if he is dreaming.
Very correctly executed, notwithstanding, very correctly!
Not one smooth head is ruffled, not one white tie unloosed,
not a shirt front creased.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i334.jpg" width="340" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We must however believe that the coat inconveniences the
gentlemen in their work, for with very leisurely movements,
<span class="xxpn" id="p303">[p303]</span> and perfect indifference, the seven Craggs go to the back of the
stage, and there, one, two, three, in time, as though performing
an exercise, they take off their coats and appear in fourteen
shirt sleeves.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i335.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And from that moment, for the space of half an hour, they
execute the most wonderful acrobatic feats.</p>

<p>The seven Craggs mount upon each other, then fall away
like houses built of cards. MM. Craggs senior turn MM.
Craggs junior round their arms. One half of the Craggs
always has the legs in the air, whilst the other half is head
downwards. And what deportment! how completely it differs
from the smiles, kisses thrown to the public, and rolling eyes
<span class="xxpn" id="p304">[p304]</span> of the Italian acrobat! We shall see that in the Molier Circus,
authentic gentlemen have been converted into passable clowns.
Messrs. Craggs have proved to us, a more unexpected fact,
that perfect gentlemen can be made from professional
clowns.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i336.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Since it is my mission to betray the secrets confided to me,
I will tell the public, the whole world, that the Craggs are not
seven brothers, as we might be tempted to believe, but a family
consisting of the father, six sons, and one little sister Cragg.</p>

<p>Mr. Cragg, the father, is nearly forty-two years old, he looks
like the brother of his eldest son, who is not yet twenty-four.
The little girl who so bravely wears the black coat asserts
that she is fourteen. I kissed her, after the performance, and
complimented her most sincerely.
<span class="xxpn" id="p305">[p305]</span></p>

<p>“She is a little Australian,” said her father, smiling kindly
at her.</p>

<p>“An Australian, Mr. Cragg?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was born at Sydney, whilst her brothers and I
were performing in New Zealand and China.”</p>

<p>The Craggs have just returned from Pekin.</p>

<p>They have travelled round the world, with gardenias in
their buttonholes, and Barnum has thrown golden bridges
across the ocean for them.</p>

<p>I told you that the time had come for writing a monograph
of the clown-king!</p>

<h2 title="Chapter XII. The Private Circus." id="chapter-12">CHAPTER XII.
<span class="smaller">THE PRIVATE CIRCUS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="first">Whilst the acrobat was endeavouring to become a
man of the world, the man of the world was becoming
an excellent acrobat. The “governing classes” determined
to have their Léotard. The gentleman quitted his stall in the
circus to ascend the pad and the trapeze.
<span class="xxpn" id="p308">[p308]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Viaud—in literature Pierre Loti—was one of
the first to achieve this metamorphosis.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i340.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Those who have read his novels with a little attention
will know the high value he places upon human beauty.
<em class="e000I2">Azyadée</em> particularly, contains whole pages, infinitely curious,
a little disquieting, very pagan in their candour, in which
<span class="xxpn" id="p309">[p309]</span> gymnastics are extolled with technical knowledge and lyric
warmth.</p>

<p>M. Pierre Loti thinks, with the Platonics, that the body
should be formed and embellished with as much refinement as
the intelligence. Certain of the superiority of his mind, he
wished that this cerebral strength should be served by the
muscles of an athlete, and worked with indefatigable patience
to correct in himself the weakness of nature.</p>

<p>And he has really transformed his body by the practice of
gymnastics. Now, well set up, although of medium height,
he produces an impression of strength and agility. One feels
that in him exists that spring of elasticity which raises a body
from the soil and wrests it from the laws of gravitation.</p>

<p>And indeed, or so it has been said, Pierre Loti joined
a troupe of acrobats a few years ago, and appeared as a
trapeze “novelty” in a circus in the south of France. The
Naval Ministry would have been agitated by this whim....</p>

<p>Is this story true?</p>

<p>At all events it is probable, and it proves—and this is all that
concerns us—the high esteem which, at the present time, a
gentleman can feel for an art which the last generation
decidedly ignored too much.</p>

<p>The men of taste, even, who clearly perceived the
picturesque side of a circus, were not too numerous.</p>

<p>The collection of M. Louis is perhaps unique in the
world.</p>

<p>Paul Ginisty, who has examined these treasures, has related
his impressions, with much ability and grace, in the <em class="e000I2">Dieu
Bibelot</em>.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he says, “the Montchanin Circus?”
<span class="xxpn" id="p310">[p310]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i342.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You do not go into it through a large entrance, you need
only knock at the door of a charming little hôtel. You do not
<span class="xxpn" id="p311">[p311]</span> find in it any of those odours usually noticed in hippique
establishments, because it contains neither arena, stables, nor
horses. The title of ‘circus’ is simply the familiar name
given to the collection of an old amateur, who dwells in a
calm quiet street in the Quartier de Villiers, and who has
really a passion for everything relating to equestrian exhibitions.
No one possesses as many traditions of circus art as he
does. He has not only known all those who for thirty or
thirty-five years have distinguished themselves in the arena;
but he has also lived with every dynasty of ring-masters,
Hercules and jugglers of the past. In fact, he has surrounded
himself with an infinitely curious collection of prints and
documents of all ages referring to the circus. It includes
portraits of all the masters, specimens of costumes, placards,
programmes, and advertisements of ‘phenomena.’</p>

<p>“Some of these prints, drawings by Carle Vernet, engravings
of Grimaldi and Debucourt, are artistically interesting; others
are simply typical. There is not one corner of the hôtel
without some of these pleasing designs.”</p>

<p>Another lover of the circus, no longer content with collecting
portfolios full of beautiful equestrian placards, determined to
quietly live the healthy existence of a circus performer for his
own amusement. When first the public read in the paragraphs
of the society papers that Señor Molieros had built a circus,
in his private house, in which he was ring-master, and trained
horses for the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> and other performances, people
said:</p>

<p>“It is simply a whim of a Spanish grandee.”</p>

<p>The truth is that Señor Molieros is really named Ernest
Molier, that he is a Manceau, and that possessing a large
<span class="xxpn" id="p312">[p312]</span> fortune, he prefers spending it upon horses that he loves,
rather than with gamblers, who bore him.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i344.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Not every one who asked for admittance to the small hôtel
<span class="xxpn" id="p313">[p313]</span> in the Rue de Boulogne obtained it. Molier’s intrepidity led
him to prefer vicious horses, and difficulties only increased his
eagerness to conquer them. “He was never happier than when
some dangerous animal that no one had hitherto ventured to
mount, would obey his eyes and his lightest touch. Like
Anthony he would have rather killed the horse than allowed
him to disobey!”<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Ernest Molier has often told me that he did not learn his
profession from books. You have seen too in the perusal of
these monographs, that the science of the circus is entirely
traditional. But you would never guess with how much
suspicious jealousy the <em class="e000I2">banquiste</em> defends the guardianship of
his secrets. I have learnt by experience how unwillingly he
confides even a few items of his knowledge to a writer, who
can never be a rival; and from this I can imagine how much
he would distrust a horseman. Only Molier’s integrity and
military frankness enabled him to overcome this dislike.</p>

<p>Besides, Molier has the circus genius, and a man of genius
can dispense with masters.</p>

<p>In the Rue Blanche his stable overcrowded him. Air and
space were both lacking. In 1879 he therefore transported his
luggage and caravan to Rue Benouville, at the gate of the Bois.
A house, fencing hall and stables sprang from the soil as
though built by magic. The riding-school was ornamented
with the decorations of the fête of the Paris-Murcie and was
converted into a regular circus. A few boxes were added
for the use of privileged spectators; no one then foresaw the
wonderful success obtained by the meetings in the Rue de
<span class="xxpn" id="p314">[p314]</span> Benouville; the preparations were only made for the reception
of friends.</p>

<p>They came in crowds to visit the hospitable mansion.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i346.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i347.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The fencing hall was opened to them; they fenced, vaulted,
practised with the dumb-bells and mounted the trapeze. But
Molier, faithful to his passion, devoted himself to his horses.
He trained <em class="e000I2">Arlequin</em>, a dappled grey Russian horse, in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p315">[p315]</span> arts of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>, which consist in performing the Spanish
walk and trot, in galloping, cantering, changing feet, balancing
on the fore legs, as well as on the hind quarters;<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> “and also
<em class="e000I2">Blondin</em>, a superb Norman chestnut, with a light mane and
<span class="xxpn" id="p316">[p316]</span> tail, a horse trained in the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em> almost in the same style
as <em class="e000I2">Arlequin</em>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i348.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Molier also trained equestrians for the pad and the <em class="e000I2">haute
école</em>. His first pupil was the pretty Mademoiselle de Trèves.
<span class="xxpn" id="p317">[p317]</span> He placed her on a horse, and made her an exceptionally good
rider, capable of riding standing, on a bare-backed horse and
of leaping over barriers, in the best style of the <em class="e000I2">haute école</em>.
Then followed Mademoiselle Irma Viollat, one of the ornaments
of the corps de ballet. The master taught her to repeat on
horseback all the dances that she excelled in upon the stage.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i349.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Insensibly a crowd of amateurs had gathered round Molier;
and they formed a complete company. At last Molier one
day yielded to the entreaties of his comrades and consented to
give a performance in his circus.
<span class="xxpn" id="p318">[p318]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i350.jpg" width="533" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was quite understood that it was to be a private
entertainment. <span class="xxpn" id="p319">[p319]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i351.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All Paris tried to get in.</p>

<p>Artists and society people broke open the doors.
<span class="xxpn" id="p320">[p320]</span></p>

<p>They left the circus in great astonishment, and loudly
proclaimed their admiration.</p>

<p>Of course, the newspapers were full of it. The people who
had been left out were very severe. They declared it was a
scandal. Noblemen playing at acrobatics were an easy subject
for abuse. “What do you say? Messrs. Hubert de la Rochefoucauld,
Martel, de Saint-Aldegonde, de Maulde, de Visocq,
de Sainte-Marie, Courtay, d’Arquevilliers and de Pully had
appeared in spangled tights?”</p>

<p>They recalled the Romans during the decadence, and M.
Prudhomme crossed his arms upon his breast in the attitude
of the philosopher of Couture.</p>

<p>Since then, men have realized that these acrobatic amusements
were only the artistic form, the blast of trumpets
preceding the vanguard of the revolution, which has just
ended in the formation of the Society of Physical Education.</p>

<p>Molier and his friends, who, with legitimate pride, remember
that on one occasion they presented the Duchesse d’Uzès with
50,000 francs for the benefit of the Hospital for Incurables,
claim, with some reason, a share in influencing this national
movement. They certainly rendered bodily exercises fashionable
once more, and this is a great deal in a country where
routine is the only queen that has never been dethroned.</p>

<p>Moreover the warm applause which greeted the tirade of
the Brettigny in the <em class="e000I2">Révoltée</em> last winter, proved to the
acrobats of the Cirque Molier that they had won their cause in
the opinion of the public.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i353.jpg" width="600" height="763" alt="" />
<div class="caption">M. ERNEST MOLIER.</div>
</div>

<p>You may remember the indignant tirade in which the
gentleman acrobat defends his favourite amusement against
the witticisms of Madame Herbeau:
<span class="xxpn" id="p321">[p321]</span></p>

<p>“What do you want a man of our class to do at the present
time? Politics are prohibited. They are monopolized by
other buffoons, whose exercises are much more dangerous for
the spectators and not so amusing. The army? Well, it is
a refuge for those who have courage, and I have belonged
<span class="xxpn" id="p322">[p322]</span> to it. But there was too little to do in time of peace.
Literature? I should not know how to begin, and I dare own
that I would not deign to adopt it. Naturalism is too dull,
and dilettantism too sterile. I find it better to enjoy life than
to write about it. You say that I degrade my race? Nay, I
revive it. You know the language used by the rhetors and
journalists in describing the corrupt scions of the old aristocracy.
Well, we will regenerate this corrupt youth! We are strong,
our muscles are like those of the street porters, of our ancestors
the Frank warriors, of the companions of Charlemagne, who
were only superb brutes.”<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i355.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Molier and his friends have triumphed without noise, just as
they resisted the ill-humour of foolish grumblers without
bluster.</p>

<p>During the last ten years this clever troupe of amateurs
has wonderfully increased. It now includes two new star
equestrians—Mademoiselle Blanche Lamidey and Miss Anna.
You have probably seen <em class="e000I2">Mazeppa</em> performed in a circus, at
least once in your life, but, since Miss Ada Menken, you have
never seen a very young girl, thrown on her back, held by one
foot only, her loosened hair dragging in the sand, and in this
dangerous position leaping with her galloping horse an
arrangement of several barriers.</p>

<div class="figcenter size1">
<img src="images/i357.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Nor since Jenny O’Brien left us for America have we ever
seen a woman ride standing upon two horses with as much
dainty jauntiness, self-possession and audacity as Miss Anna.
And then how well she dresses! Lovers of Florentine bronzes
will never forget a certain suit of grey tights, a harlequin’s
<span class="xxpn" id="p324">[p324]</span> costume, cut low and heart shaped at the neck, with greaves
of the same grey tint below the knees.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i358.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Molier has grouped a number of pretty women, actresses,
<span class="xxpn" id="p325">[p325]</span> artists, and young men of the world round these two charming
girls. Amongst the ladies are Mesdemoiselles Lavigne and
Desoder from the Palais Royal, Mademoiselle Felicia Mallet,
Mademoiselle Renée Maupin, from the Opera, Jeanne Becker,
Léa d’Asco, etc.;—amongst the men: Messrs. Frédéric
Vavasseur, Jules Ravaut, Arthus, Gerbaut, Adrien Marie,
Craffty, Goubie, Pantelli, J. Lewis-Brown. I must apologize
to those whom I forget to name.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i359.jpg" width="340" height="510" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With these resources the performance of a pantomime was
easily arranged, and these spectacles are one of the chief
<span class="xxpn" id="p326">[p326]</span> attractions of the entertainments given in the Rue Benouville.
It was here that Félicien Champsaur made the first trial of
contemporary pantomime by which he amuses us without
introducing the form of Pierrot or the bat of Harlequin.</p>

<div class="figcenter size3">
<img src="images/i360.jpg" width="340" height="453" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Why,” he reflected, “should we show the fashionable
people who annually fill the boxes of the Molier, some old
fairy story remounted in a new form? Men of the present
day with money and audacity accomplish greater prodigies
than the magicians of old.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p327">[p327]</span></p>

<p>M. Champsaur resolved to show us his contemporaries
at work—and this is the plot of his pantomime—</p>

<p>The charming Mademoiselle Rivolta, from the Eden, appeared
disguised as a little Spring looking for her course.
No one had thought of using her to fill a lake, rush down a
waterfall or turn a mill. She therefore wandered about the
Cirque Molier, shedding floods of tears.</p>

<p>Good Luck, who never likes to see pretty girls cry, led two
speculators in the same direction. They remark to each
other:—</p>

<p>“Look! here’s a little Spring! And there’s no casino on
the bank!”</p>

<p>“No race game!”</p>

<p>“No gambling house!”</p>

<p>“Cannot this little Spring cure some illness?”</p>

<p>“If not, she is the only one of her kind!”</p>

<p>To satisfy themselves on this point they then take Mademoiselle
Rivolta’s hand, lead her to the house of Madame
Dezoder, a lady doctor in the same neighbourhood, and knock
at the door.</p>

<p>Armed with a goblet, Madame Dezoder tastes Mademoiselle
Rivolta.</p>

<p>After carefully testing her, her gesture says “Pooh!”</p>

<p>“What does that matter?” replied the bankers. “We
will bottle Mademoiselle Rivolta and, with a good label, she
will cure as well as her companions.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than it was done. And since a godmother
was required for the new Spring launched upon the world, the
bankers fetch Fortune, Mademoiselle Renée Maupin, from
the Opera! <span class="xxpn" id="p328">[p328]</span></p>

<p>Ah! what a delightful person!</p>

<p>I always liked Fortune instinctively, before I knew her;
but since I have seen her feet, figure, and eyes!&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i362.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You shall cure everything!” Fortune assured the Spring.</p>

<p>They placed the bottle in the doctor’s house and in it
Mademoiselle Rivolta, who looked like a saint in her shrine.</p>

<p>Then the procession of those wounded by Life (<em class="e000I2">Ereintés
de la Vie</em>)—this is the title of the pantomime—commences.
<span class="xxpn" id="p329">[p329]</span></p>

<p>They are all invalided by love: first, a number of pretty
girls who have flirted too much; then all the gentlemen who
have been wounded by these flirtations.</p>

<p>Love himself comes to the Spring.</p>

<p>He is very ill.</p>

<p>His poor little wings hang down his back in a lamentable
way.</p>

<p>“Douche him! Douche him!”</p>

<p>The child is dipped in the water and is drawn out transformed
into a Farnese Hercules, with enormous muscles which
stand out in huge rolls upon his arms from the shoulder to the
elbow.</p>

<p>The entertainment closes by a procession accompanied by
a blast of trumpets, at the end of which appears the Golden
Calf, led by Fortune with a leash.</p>

<p>I have quoted this pantomime by M. Champsaur in preference
to others of more recent date which have been equally
successful, because it clearly indicates the nature of the entertainment
given in the Cirque Molier.</p>

<p>People see and perform in the Rue Benouville pieces that
could not be played or shown elsewhere; for here the audience
and the actors are all people of the same education, the
same surroundings, who know each other.</p>

<p>The doors have been more widely opened than they formerly
were. But they are still closely guarded, the members of
the society intend to amuse themselves as they please in their
own circle, and to exclude anything that offends them.</p>

<p>For instance, you will not find either at the rehearsals or at
the performances in the Rue Benouville in the boxes or behind
the scenes, the shadow of a professional actor.

<div class="figcenter size2">
<img src="images/i364.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The door is closed against theatrical men.</p>

<p>What! even “Chose” and “Machin?”
<span class="xxpn" id="p331">[p331]</span></p>

<p>Even for them.</p>

<p>The “cross” and the banner are both useless. <em class="e000I2">Monsieur
le Sociétaire</em> has vainly tried to force a door which is half
open for the <em class="e000I2">banquistes</em>&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>A voice has cried to him from the trapeze, “We are very
sorry, sir! But we have retained the prejudices of the
comedians.”</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p>Original printed spelling and grammar is generally retained.
Original small caps type <em class="e00S02">Looks Like This</em>.
Footnotes were renumbered and moved from the ends of pages to the
ends of chapters. Illustrations were moved out of paragraphs to
between paragraphs. Ellipses look like the originals.
The transcriber created the cover image and hereby transfers
it to the public. The original
printed page numbers are indicated thus: “[p089]”.</p>

<p>“Lemaitre” was
changed to “Lemaître” in the two places it was originally printed (in
a footnote, and in the index). The entry “Paquerette” in the index
had no page number associated with it, and neither “paquerette” nor
“pâquerette” appear elsewhere in the book.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p-x">x</a>, ERRATA: The error mentioned in
the first note, regarding “Vitellii”, has been corrected at
page <a href="#p078">78</a>. The second note—‘Page 206, line
3 from top, <em class="e000I2">for</em> “Naet Salsbury”, <em
class="e000I2">read</em>, “Nael Salsbury”’—is wrong. Page 206 was
actually printed with “Naet Salisbury”. In this ebook, page <a
href="#p206">206</a> has been changed to read “Nael Salsbury”. The
original “Salisbury” was printed only once, while “Salsbury” was
printed in several places.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p063">63</a>: “nouée was exhibited” was changed to
“noués was exhibited”</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p194">194</a>: Greek phrase "Ἵππος μετέωρος" may be
transliterated as "Hippos meteôros".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p225">225</a>: the word “Yotshitaro” is spelled
“Yotshitatro” in the index.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p238">238</a>: “Emilie Loisset” was changed to
“Émilie Loisset”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p262">262</a>: “admirn g” was changed to
“admiring”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p274">274</a>: “them selves” changed to
“themselves”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p331">331</a>: the index entry “Bretonnière”
probably refers to “Brettonière” on page <a href="#p-ix">ix</a>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p334">334</a>: the index entry “Jaclley” was
changed to “Jackley”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p335">335</a>: the index entry “Linsky, 13”
probably refers to “Linski” on page <a href="#p013">13</a>. The entry
“Mallet (Félicia)” doubtless refers to Felicia Mallet on page <a
href="#p325">325</a>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p336">336</a>: the index entry “Worenzoff, 74”
might refer to “Worouzof”, which actually occurred on page <a
href="#p075">75</a>. The entry “Vissocq (de), 320” probably refers
to “Visocq”, as printed on page <a href="#p320">320</a>. The entry
“Violat (Irma), 317” probably refers to “Viollat” on page <a
href="#p317">317</a>.</p>
